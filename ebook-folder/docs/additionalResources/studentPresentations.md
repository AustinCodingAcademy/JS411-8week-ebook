# Daily Student Presentations

There will be no student presentation for the first class. We'll discuss the purpose of presentations and how they will be assigned for future classes.

In order to develop our students' communication skills around software development, each student will plan, practice, and teach to the class on a subject listed here or in the home page of this textbook. The subject doesn't have to be closely related to what is currently being studied. Another objective of these presentations is to give cursory introductions to important topics that we don't have time to cover in the course.

Students should prepare in advance, and take their responsibility to the class and themselves seriously. Take this time now to decide and record who will present starting next class, Day 2, through Day 4, then Week 5 through Day 16, * classes total. The first three classes, your prompt is: Pitch your graduation app to the class. What’s the problem? How does this app solve it?
