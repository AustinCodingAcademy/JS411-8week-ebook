# Interview Challenges

## Why Train for Interviews?

Interviewing for development jobs is tough! To prepare you for the challenges ahead we will practice whiteboarding in front of the class every day. Think of it as a warm-up for the project that awaits. The whiteboarding challenges should be taken seriously and practiced even outside of class. Help yourself by following these steps to attack the problem, work through the problem and collaborate with your interviewer (instructor):

## How to Solve Your Challenge

- [ ] Restate the question aloud.
- [ ] Write the question out at the top of the whiteboard.
- [ ] Ask any clarifying questions you need.
- [ ] Invoke the function and write out the expected output given the sample input. If none is given, make it up.
Write out a code plan to the side of the whiteboard.
Speak aloud every thought you have. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART!
- [ ] Build the structure of your function(s).
- [ ] Slowly work through your code plan, building the steps you need.
- [ ] Don't be afraid to mess up and say it aloud.
- [ ] It's not about finding the solution. It's about collaborating and working toward a solution!
- [ ] After you finish, take a picture and transfer it to a Repl.it when you get home.

## Steps to Whiteboarding Success

1. Restate, rewrite, and clarify the question
1. Write the expected return given the input
1. Make a code plan and speak aloud with your interviewers/team
1. Test and come up with edge cases
1. Revise if you can for efficiency

## The Prompts

### Class 1

- [ ] **Prompt 1: none** - *No whiteboard training the first day.*

### Class 2

- [ ] **Prompt 1: Largest-Smallest** - *How do you find the largest and smallest number in an unsorted integer array?*

### Class 3

- [ ] **Prompt 1: sumPairs** - *How do you find all pairs of an integer array whose sum is equal to a given number?*

```javascript
  const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 32, 0, -16, 8]

  sumPairs(arr, 16) // --> [[8, 8], [14, 2], [0, 16], [1, 15], [32, -16]]
```

### Class 4

- [ ] **Prompt 1: areAnagrams** - *How do you check if two strings are anagrams of each other? Build a program that does just that; return Boolean*

In class we'll work on solving problems while communicating to a group. To get better at this (and you will), you'll have to practice on your own every day. YES, the first few times you work on this you're going to get stuck, frustrated, and want to give up. That's okay. Just take a breathe and take some time away from it. Ten minutes later, come back to it. Then look at the answer. Understand how it was solved and try to repeat it for yourself. In this way you can learn from REALLY smart people. Slowly, but surely, you will pick up the patterns.

We want you to succeed! To make sure our students are doing the right practice, every day, for themselves we're going to give you a problem to work on here. But if you're wanting more to work on try these sites:

- [ ] [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [ ] [Geeks4Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
- [ ] [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [ ] [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/)

In fact, you'll want to get on **HackerRank** and **LeetCode** sooner rather than later because they actually track your progress and your profile is searchable by hiring managers and recruiters!

Remember to follow the rules to whiteboarding success:

Restate, rewrite, and clarify the question
Write the expected return given an input
Make a code plan and speak aloud with your interviewers/team/self
Test and come up with edge case scenarios
Revise if you can for efficiency


How do you count the number of vowels and consonants in a given string?

```javascript
  const myWord = "puppy"

  const count = (word) => {
    // what goes here?
    return // consonants = 3, vowels = 2
  }

  count(myWord)
  ```

<!-- Prompt: How is a [bubble sort algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/) implemented?

```javascript
    const arrayOfNumbers = [2, 8, 9, 3, 10]

    const myBubbleSort = (arg1) => {}  

    myBubbleSort(input) // returns [2, 3, 8, 9, 10]
```

Don't be afraid to Google around and figure out how this is done.

 Prompt: [How do you send a JSON object to a server using JavaScript?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-send-a-json-object-to-a-server-using-javascript/)
