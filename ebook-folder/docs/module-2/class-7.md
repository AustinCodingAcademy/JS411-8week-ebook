## KNOW YOUR STUDENT. KNOW THE CONTEXT.

Learning doesn’t happen in a vacuum. It’s progressively built on top of fundamental understandings over time and with effort. It can also be crafted to plan for future understandings. It’s all about context.

Obviously, your students will know more on Day 10 than they know on day 1 but the fact remains they still have a context for what they’re learning on Day 1. That context may be Object-Oriented Design or it may only be knowing how to search on Google, either way when you know their previous understandings you can relate it to what they’re currently learning and build upon their current knowledge.

In the beginning, relating programming concepts to your students can be challenging but a surefire way not to relate to their current understanding is to not ask them what they know. Learning about what their past careers are, what their hobbies are, their previous experiences, and what they know about programming so far will give you tools to use to help them understand the lesson.

Today we are going to practice what we learned last night about React Router. Below are some screenshots of a simple website for cars. We will finish this website by:

- [ ] adding routing with React Router,
- [ ] building a component for the cars detail page,
- [ ] and finally routing to the new component.

Take a look at the images below and notice the URLs in them. Apparently our web designers want these specific URLs for these components.

### Project Instructions

Fork and clone the following repo: [411_wk4_day1_react_router repository](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/411_wk4_day1_react_router). The instructions are in the README.

### Push Yourself Further

Follow along with [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59IXY5IDrBA). Keep in mind that they do things a little differently but it's good to know different ways to write routers.
