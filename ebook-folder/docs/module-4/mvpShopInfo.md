# After Graduation

**How do you get a job without experience, and how do you get experience without a job?**

## Our New Initiative

To help bridge the gap between graduation and full-time employment, Zollege, our parent company, has created an in-house web development agency.  The goal is to give graduates the opportunity to get paid to do professional work while still having time to actively continue their job search. 

In order to make this program available to the most graduates, we are asking for a time commitment of 10 hours a week for 8 - 10 weeks.  In return, you will be paid $15/hr, work on 2 public facing projects that you can add to your portfolio, and include a programmer position at Zollege, LLC to your linkedin.  

There are a limited number of spots available and you may end up on a waiting list for a few weeks, but all grads who want to get into the program will be accepted.
