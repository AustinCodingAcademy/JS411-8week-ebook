- [ ] Compare your Google Drawings to your teammate's and decide what tweaks need to be made.
- [ ] Agree upon one diagram that clearly represents your app.
- [ ] Take the flow to another group and ask them to walk through it for themselves without your help. Did it make sense to them?
- [ ] Repeat the last step.
- [ ] What tasks are on your Trello board that you think you can start doing today? Finish today?
- [ ] Go do it. Try to time box your tasks. Set a timer for 15 minutes and see what you can get done in that time.
- [ ] When the timer goes off, stand up, stretch, walk around, breathe, count to 30, then return.
- [ ] Rinse and repeat.
