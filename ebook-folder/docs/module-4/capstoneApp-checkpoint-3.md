# The Capstone App

The purpose of the Capstone Project is to celebrate the student's accomplishments while demonstrating their mastery of the skills they set forth to learn. The completion of the Capstone Project is a requirement for graduation, receipt of certificate, as well as a pre-requisite to employment. (An employer wants to know you know how to build and figure problems out. Show them with this!)

## The Rubric

- [ ] **40pts** - App is hosted
- [ ] **40pts** - Is Full-stack (Database, Server, and Client)
- [ ] **20pts** - Authorization and Authentication
- [ ] **Bonus +20pts** - Utilizes another API

 ## To Graduate

For specific requirements refer to the [Graduation Prerequisites](./../additionalResources/graduationPrerequisites.md) for a complete list of requirements for your Graduation Presentation, Certification and Completion of this program.

## To Present at Graduation Ceremony

To qualify for **presenting your App** to the public at graduation ceremony please see [Presentations Qualifications](./../additionalResources/presentationsQualifications.md)

## Tie It All Together 

## Big Picture 

So far We’ve shown you the little pieces of building a full stack application. Today let’s take a look at putting everything together and understanding the big picture of our fullstack application. Since the first week of this course we presented you with a problem: Build a fullstack application. You have presented your ideas and as we’ve gone further and further you have started drawing out your ideas, created your database but maybe we don’t understand how it all fits together. Let’s try to fix that and give you the big picture overview you’ve been asking for.  Fork and clone the github repo down below. Follow along using the repo to maximize the effect. Each section is detailed and gives you all the tools you need to finish your final capstone. The three big picture ideas are broken down and should help you understand how it all fits together.

## Fullstack Check List 

- [ ] Ideation & MVP
- [ ] Database and Server
- [ ] Front-end    

- [Overview video](Clayton video link)

Each one of these steps are crucial to finish your applications and now let’s break down each step to help you understand how they all work together. 

## Ideation & MVP 

When you started in course 101 you’ve been planning and writing down all of your ideas, building on them as you've gone through this course. It’s extremely important that every time we start a new project we plan as detailed as possible, so when we start typing our code we already know what we’re doing. While going through this course we made blogs, ER diagrams, and presented our ideas so that in the end we have a solid foundation. We then took the time to understand our data needs and what kind of data we want to store or be able to access. Finally we started drawing what our front end looks like or what the user will see when they access our projects. Hopefully all of this was stored and organized in our Trello boards and if you used Trello you now will see why its a great tool and one that puts you ahead of the curve with planning.

Now that we understand this first step take the time to go over your notes and re-read everything. Refresh yourself and then come back for the next step.

## Database and Server 

Alright so we’ve planned and planned we did our first step and we have a solid understanding of what were creating. Its time to run through our backend and create our database and server. Remember the backend is the bones and spine of our capstone. To succeed in your final project we need to understand how it all works and then implement this in our own repo.  

## Back-End checklist 

- [ ] Create GoogleCloud Database
- [ ] Connect and seed using MySQL workbench
- [ ] Create Github Repo for the source code of your server
- [ ] CI/CD with App Engine, Codeship, Github

Okay so we’ve gone through our checklist, watched the video, and really understand how our backend is working. Again take the time to reflect and read everything we just did before moving on to the final step. 

## Front-end 

We have a solid foundation of what our app does and created our backend to reflect the data we need to use and store. Now it’s time to Create our Client side so we have something unique to show our users. The backend of applications can be overwhelming sometimes, so give yourself a pat on the back finishing it and completing 2/3rds of your capstone! Now it’s time to take all that creativity you have and make something beautiful with it. We learned html, css, and react and now it’s time to use those new react skills.

Congratulations! You now have the big picture of everything we've done. Remember to reference back here as you put the finishing touches on your capstone.
