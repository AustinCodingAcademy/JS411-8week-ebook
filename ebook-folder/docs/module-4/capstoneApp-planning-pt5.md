# Capstone Planning - Part 5

*Success is not an activity but a process.*

## Step 7: Predict your Problems and Search GitHub for Solutions

This step is going to be harder than you think and that’s okay. You can circle back to it as you need. But attempting to predict your problems now will pay huge dividends later. Start by asking your instructor for guidance on specific parts of your app you think will be more difficult. Also use GitHub. Remember, this is a social media for developers and many people post the code for free to the public here. Simply search: “Angular sign-in component” or “React drag-and-drop”. Many times you can find solutions to problems you have.

Over the past two weeks you've been led through the following steps as a way of guiding your thinking and helping you to create a visualized organization for your thoughts. We want you to be successful and one of the things we must teach our students is how to think like programmer, a good programmer.

Let's review the steps we've worked through.

- [ ] **Step 5:** Plan User Flow

- [ ] **Step 7:** Predict your Problems and Research
