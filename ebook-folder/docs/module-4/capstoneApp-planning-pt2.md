# Capstone App Planning Pt. 2

*Weeks of coding can save you hours of planning.*

## Overview

Last week you started planning and laying out the look and functionality of your app. Hopefully you didn't skip any of those steps and you exchanged contact info with your teammate(s) because we have some more planning practices to teach you.

Continuing on...

### Step 3: Check Your Backend

Does it match up with the True Core Functionality of Your App?

> NOTE: Don’t skip this step. Building your front-end depends on your backend.

At the end of your 300 level class, you built a database and server for the start of your Capstone Project. Hopefully, you followed along with the directions to have a solid beginning to your app. However, your ideas have probably changed and maybe your data needs have too.

You must draw out the data you’ll need for each component of your app so that you can plan your backend. When signing in, you’ll need access to your users and a POST route to take a username and password for verification. When editing a profile you’ll need a PUT route that takes in user info and updates the user’s data. This is what you’re really learning in this course, how to program, which is to say, you think about the steps a user will take from opening your app to closing your app and all of the data that’s needed to complete those tasks. More on this in [Step 5: User Flow Chart](./capstoneApp-planning-pt3.md).

Remember, back-ends come before front-ends. Why? Because the front-end depends on the data coming from the back-end (your server and any third-party APIs you choose to use). Your front-end only serves as an interface for your users to interact with the data you store in the database. Quite simply put, make sure your backend matches your front-end’s needs, **first**.

Take the time to consider what your back-end has now and what may need to change. Work with your partner to clear this up, list it out on your Trello board, and make a plan of action to solve it! Remember: small steps lead to long journeys!

### Step 4: Sketch out What it Should Look Like, Visually

Let’s get out of *backend country* for a minute and think about what the app looks like to the user. This will build up into Step 5, so don’t skip this one either!

What does your app look like when a user arrives at your app’s URL? Do they click “Sign-Up” or start typing their information immediately? Draw it. Seriously, go steal your kids paper and map pencils and get to drawing!

After the sign-up do they go straight to their profile or do they get a prompt to first enter data related to your app, i.e. in the Budget App mentioned above you might be prompted to enter a budget amount. Draw it.

Each time you answer these questions, draw it! Seriously, nothing comes from nothing. So start drawing something, even if it’s horrendously ugly, draw it. You’ll figure it out and make it look better as you build it up. But now is the time to get these ideas into a more solid form; from ethereal/gaseous ideation to moldable jello on paper and eventually to code that tells a browser to do these specific tasks with the UI you envision.

## Practice Problem

In class we'll work on solving problems while communicating to a group. To get better at this (and you will), you'll have to practice on your own every day. YES, the first few times you work on this you're going to get stuck, frustrated, and want to give up. That's okay. Just take a breathe and take some time away from it. Ten minutes later, come back to it. Then look at the answer. Understand how it was solved and try to repeat it for yourself. In this way you can learn from REALLY smart people. Slowly, but surely, you will pick up the patterns.

We want you to succeed! To make sure our students are doing the right practice, every day, for themselves we're going to give you a problem to work on here. But if you're wanting more to work on try these sites:

- [ ] [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [ ] [Geeks4Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
- [ ] [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [ ] [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/)

In fact, you'll want to get on **HackerRank** and **LeetCode** sooner rather than later because they actually track your progress and your profile is searchable by hiring managers and recruiters!

Remember to follow the rules to whiteboarding success:

Restate, rewrite, and clarify the question
Write the expected return given an input
Make a code plan and speak aloud with your interviewers/team/self
Test and come up with edge case scenarios
Revise if you can for efficiency

 > **Prompt: Collatz Conjecture** - *Start with a number n > 1. Find the number of steps it takes to reach one using the following process: If n is even, divide it by 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.*

Don't worry about code on this one, get it down on paper first!!
