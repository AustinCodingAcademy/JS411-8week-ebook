We'll spend 30 minutes after Whiteboarding and Discussion to plan our Capstone Project with your teammates then we'll move on to discussion, planning, and the building of your [Checkpoint 2 Project](./checkpointTwo-smallBizApp.md).

### Instructions

#### Part 1 Instructions

In your pre-class lesson, you read about the importance of your back-end providing the data your front-end needs to share with users. Get with your partner now and:

- [ ] Take a look at the core functions of your app.
- [ ] Look at the routes and database your server from 311 currently have.
- [ ] What needs to be added?
- [ ] What needs to be changed?
- [ ] Write it out, plan it into tasks, and add it to your Trello board.
- [ ] Bring out the drawings you did last night. Compare and consider.
- [ ] Do you two have the same vision? Are you able to agree?
- [ ] Make re-drawings and plan together what it will look like. Consider too that you've been using Material UI. Should you use the components offered with it?
- [ ] Take pictures of your drawings and add them to your blank sign-in repo in a folder called: `planningImages`
- [ ] List anything important and link your Trello board to your `README.md` file so you have a place to gather all of your needed materials.

#### Part 2 Instructions

Now that you've got some plans laid out for your Capstone app let's look at your [Checkpoint 2 Project](./checkpointTwo-smallBizApp.md). All of the information and instruction you'll need is on that page.

> Remember, you also have the next class to work on the checkpoint. Spend time researching any material you feel uncomfortable with.
