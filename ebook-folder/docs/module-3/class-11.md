## Creation Time, 60-90 mins

Today we are going to create a mock-import utility that we can use in our cars application. We will use Redux Thunk to hit an API that brings back cars data. We will then allow the user to delete each import. We also want to keep a current count of the imported cars. Some images below will show what the webpage should look like.

### Examples

### Project Instructions

- [ ] Fork and clone the [Redux-Thunk Repo](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/411_wk6_day1_redux_thunk)

- [ ] Follow the directions in the `README.md` to complete the project. The project directions are also summed up below:

A lot of the Material UI documentation has been updated to support the new React feature called Hooks. We will not dive deep into the topic in this class but watch this video to understand what's going on because you likely ran across some documentation regarding hooks while building out your table for the import page, and as you move forward in your new career you will **very** likely see hooks.

### Push Yourself Further

When you've finished the project for this class you'll notice that the table is very long and you have to scroll for a bit before you get to the bottom of it. Imagine if it were 2 or 3 times that size. Imagine if there were 1000 rows. This provides a bad user experience. Reference the documentation from Material UI below and see if you can add pagination to the import table.
