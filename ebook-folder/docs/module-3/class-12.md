## Creation Time, 60-90 mins

While you might not code much today it is not a simple, boring, or *free* day. You should use the time you have today with your teammates and instructor to plan out your Capstone Project App. Today is a day for you to think more about the frontend of your Capstone App. You should already have some ideas and preferably something started but if you don't, please do that today.

There are no examples, project instructions or follow-up in today's lesson. Just use this time wisely and ask the instructor if you have any questions on the implementation of your project.

With your teammate:

- [ ] **List out the core functions of your Capstone App**
- [ ] **Compare lists and trim out unnecessary functions**
- [ ] **Agree upon the core functions together.**
- [ ] **Next, draw out the look of your app. What components will you need?**
- [ ] **Build a [Trello Board](https://trello.com/) for both of you to thoughtfully build your app**
- [ ] **Begin adding to the [Trello board](https://trello.com/) the steps you KNOW you have to do.**
- [ ] **YOU SHOULD NOT BE CODING YET.**

Here are few quotes to inspire your work today:

* *A computer program does what you tell it to do, not what you want it to do.*
* *First, solve the problem. Then, write the code. —John Johnson*
* *Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight. —Bill Gates*
* *When debugging, novices insert corrective code; experts remove defective code. —Richard Pattis*
* *Without requirements or design, programming is the art of adding bugs to an empty "text" file. —Louis Srygley*
and finally...

* *Weeks of coding can save you hours of planning.*

### Project Instructions

- [ ] 30 minutes in pairs, writing and drawing system requirements for each student's app.
- [ ] 30 minutes of volunteers at the board working with the instructor to design and plan their app.
- [ ] Rest of class dedicated to students back in pairs writing and drawing their plans together.
- [ ] Go to the blank sign-in component that's connected to your 311 Server and make a new branch called `CapstonePlanning`. Be sure you're only using one repo and not both of your teammates' repos!
- [ ] Take pictures of your drawings and add them to a folder in that repo called planningImages
- [ ] Next add the list Core Functions to a `README.md` file. Turn in the pull request as your CapstonePlanning assignment for today.
