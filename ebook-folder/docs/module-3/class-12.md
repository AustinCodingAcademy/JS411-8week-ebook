## Creation Time, 60-90 mins

While you might not code much today it is not a simple, boring, or *free* day. You should use the time you have today with your teammates and instructor to plan out your Capstone Project App Using FireBase and the FireStore **NoSQl** database. Today is a day for you to think more about the frontend of your Capstone App. You should already have some ideas and preferably something started but if you don't, please do that today.

Your project instructions Will involve creating an ER diagram today due next class.

With your teammate:

- [ ] **List out the core functions of your Capstone App**
- [ ] **Compare lists and trim out unnecessary functions**
- [ ] **Agree upon the core functions.**
- [ ] **Based on how your app will function Create an ER diagram to model your data.**
- [ ] **Next, draw out the look of your app. What components will you need?**
- [ ] **Build a [Trello Board](https://trello.com/) for both of you to thoughtfully build your app**
- [ ] **Begin adding to the [Trello board](https://trello.com/) the steps you KNOW you have to do.**
- [ ] **YOU SHOULD NOT BE CODING YET.**

Here are few quotes to inspire your work today:

* *A computer program does what you tell it to do, not what you want it to do.*
* *First, solve the problem. Then, write the code. —John Johnson*
* *Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight. —Bill Gates*
* *When debugging, novices insert corrective code; experts remove defective code. —Richard Pattis*
* *Without requirements or design, programming is the art of adding bugs to an empty "text" file. —Louis Srygley*
and finally...

* *Weeks of coding can save you hours of planning.*

### Project Instructions
- [ ] Create a repo in your github called `CapstonePlanning` and create a `README.md` file. 
- [ ] Go [here](https://app.diagrams.net/) to create a **ER Diagram** and save it to the github repo `CapstonePlanning` you created. Make sure to select the save to github option and sign in to it.
- [ ] In pairs, writing and drawing system requirements for each student's app.
- [ ] If needed volunteers at the board working with the instructor to design and plan their app.
- [ ] Next add the list Core Functions to a `README.md` file.
- [ ] If needed Take pictures of your drawings and add them to a folder in that repo called planningImages.
- [ ] Start drawing out the **ER Diagram** for your data model.
- [ ] Turn in the pull request as your CapstonePlanning assignment for today.
