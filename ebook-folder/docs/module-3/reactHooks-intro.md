# Capstone Time

*Happiness is not something you postpone for the future; it is something you design for the present. —Jim Rohn*

## Your Responsibility

We've learned so much about front-end development with React over the course of the last six weeks. Next class will be a day to work on your final projects,There will not be an assignment on it. Take the time to work on your Capstone Project before tomorrow's class.

You're very near completion of this course and of this program. you only have a few weeks left then you'll be graduating. This is where many students stumble, getting lost in the learning and not putting energy toward the building. Don't be that student! You will have a few class days to work with your instructor but most of the time you have will be on you to block out. 

Start planning now on when you will complete your Capstone App during and after this class until graduation. Remember, when you sign a contract with a company you're only making a deal to exchange your skills and time for money. So you're employer will want to know you can build during that time. Your Capstone project is your first piece of original work that proves you can do this work. 

Talk to yourself, calm yourself, focus yourself and go get some.
