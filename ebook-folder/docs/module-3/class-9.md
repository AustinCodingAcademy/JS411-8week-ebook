Today we are going to practice what we learned with Redux and mapStateToProps. We will use mapStateToProps functions to create containers and then reference the global state in our components.

- [ ] Fork and clone the following repository: [411_wk5_day1_mapstatetoprops](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/411_wk5_day1_mapstatetoprops).
- [ ] Follow the directions in the `README` to complete the project and upload the link to your GitHub repository to the appropriate assignment. The project directions are also summed up below:

### Follow-Up

Two things before you watch this video:

1. This guy is writing the component and container is the same file. He explains it. We aren't following that pattern you might see code organized this way in the future.
2. We don't need `bindActionCreators`. You'll see him import it.

### Push Yourself Further

- [ ] Follow along and build with [this Medium tutorial about React with Redux Thunk](https://medium.com/@notrab/getting-started-with-create-react-app-redux-react-router-redux-thunk-d6a19259f71f). He is introducing a couple topics we haven't talked about yet (in relation to Redux) like thunk but don't worry we will get to that stuff soon.
