# Bonus Lesson: React from HTML to JSX + Why

Now that you've seen some code that uses React, follow along with this video and build your first React app! There is no better way to learn than by doing. So, chop chop.

> Special Note: React has been updated since this video and now uses NPX: `npx create-react-app my-first-react-app`. Refer to the [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) for accurate and up-to-date info.

In this video you will learn to:

- [ ] download GitBash or use Terminal or Command Prompt
- [ ] download Chocolatey or Homebrew
- [ ] download Node.js
- [ ] `install create-react-app` (MAKE SURE YOU USE NPX!) `npx create-react-app my-first-react-app`
- [ ] create your first react app
- [ ] build components
- [ ] create state
