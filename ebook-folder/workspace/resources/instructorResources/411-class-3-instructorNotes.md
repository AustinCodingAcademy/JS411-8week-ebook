# Class 3 Instructor Notes

## SETTING EXPECTATIONS

Setting expectations may be the most fundamental practice an instructor can do for their students. By setting expectations of when assignments are due, how the student is expected to study, how the student is expected to participate in class, and what they are expected to learn, students will feel safe and secure because they have a leader that has set the boundaries for their learning experience.

This may seem dogmatic or even militaristic but, in truth, you are the leader of the class. You are the one with the knowledge and they will default to you and trust in you because you have the knowledge. Don’t assume because the students paid their money and are “adults” that they will just create a perfect learning environment that is conducive to all learners and their learning styles. No, you must be the leader. When you commit to taking on the role of leader you can set the stage for expectations and success for all of your students, not just the few that speak out.

## How to Set Expectations

Do it from the beginning. There is a natural flow that happens with all classes: the uneasy introductions phase, the slow to mingle phase, the confident/chaotic cacophony phase (you chose), to the bittersweet farewell phase. The group will evolve but you as the instructor can set the stage for positive evolution or negative evolution. By setting expectations from the beginning and upholding them throughout the course you will create a positive learning environment for positive group evolution and maximum student learning.

- [ ] Due on Sunday
 
 > There will be many assignments to turn in. By setting the due date for all assignments on the following Sunday they won’t miss a due date and not ask you about it either.

- [ ] Student-Focused & Student-Owned Learning.

  > You know as well as anyone that this technology constantly changes; your students must learn to learn on their own! If they don’t, they will not be successful in this field. This doesn’t mean you won’t be helping them along the way but it doesn’t mean you will try to “make up” for their lack of time spent in pre-class lessons. Teach your students that they must take the responsibility to read their textbook, reference documentation, complete practice problems, and watch the videos before they come into class.

- [ ] Follow-up.

  > Out of fear, students like to “suffer in silence” (struggle beyond a reasonable amount of time without asking for help). When they’re silent and look worried ask them:

    * [ ] What are the objectives of this project? Where is your code plan? 

    * [ ] What are you struggling with? What are you trying to accomplish?

    * [ ] Walk me through this app from the entry point to as far as you’ve made.
