# JS411 Overview Instructor Notes: How to Prepare for Teaching 411 

## JS411 Front-ends with React is all about (1/7)

* confidence. **Always be building confidence!**
* big picture perspective,
* and learning strong functional programming skills

### The main thrust of this course is (2/7)

* functional programming,
* and conceptualization of data flow between server and client,
* and the dispersal of data across the front-end application.

### Your students will already know (3/7)

* the syntax and semantics of JavaScript (mostly),
* They will know how to install Node packages and import objects.

**They will still need reassurance and guidance.**

### What they will need (4/7)

* a visualization of the process of architecture, planning, and building and app,
* a map they can follow and use as a guide while they dive into the syntax of each function and each component.

**Learning to be programmers NOT coders.**

## What will be a challenge (5/7)

* Component vs Function
* HOCs: React-Router & Redux
* Understanding that a function can return a function
* Understanding how the skills they learned in 101 are applicable to 411
* The DOM & elements inside of it are what they are actually creating with React.

### The solution to these challenges (6/7)

* Draw out a component(function) calling another component(function)
* Build up to Redux by explaining the need for a global state to be used by all components DAYS before teaching it on Day 9. DON'T AVOID REDUX!!
* Continue to teach them that EVERYTHING is an object. (Even functions & strings)
* Each component returns an object (a.k.a. React Element).
* The store, actions, state and even the entire React application is an object.

**Once they’ve visualized the flow of data and compartmentalized each component as objects they will be unstoppable because they now see how it all works.**

## Helpful Ways to Teach the Invisible (7/7)

* Continue to ask them to identify and explain the difference between an argument (passed at invocation) & a parameter (a local variable declared at the function signature). This helps them know when a function is being called(argument) and when a function is being declared (parameter).

* Use "Object-Thing", with properties and methods. All things are object-things. Remind them to find and use keys and values on objects with dot-notation & bracket-notation.

* Always start them with the  𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑘𝑎≥.𝑗𝑠𝑜𝑛  file for all new projects

* When debugging, remind them to start at the entry point and follow the flow to bug.

* Show them the “root” div and the first component a few times until they understand how a React App works.

* Teach REDUX! Don’t shy away from it but lean into it. Redux is a legitimate library that is here to stay but more importantly, it is a beautiful implementation of functional programming.

* Teach Redux!

* The key is teaching the flow of HOCs with React-Router first -

* then using that understanding to teach how Containers/"Wrapper Functions" work

* then Provider and Smart Containers pass information through with the store prop.

* From there, it’s best to teach MSTP and MDTP on different days

* Draw it out. Give them a map to objectively see their app.

**Ask them to explain the flow of their projects the following class day.**
