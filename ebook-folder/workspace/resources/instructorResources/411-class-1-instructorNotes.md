# JS411 Class One Instructor Notes

Whether you’re just starting out or you’ve been teaching for years, here is your first Tip for Teaching.

You’re a developer, you know how this stuff works, that’s not what you have to stress over. Instead, focus your attention on how the class will flow from beginning to end. What do the students do when they come in? How do you introduce yourself? How do you get them to introduce themselves? What’s the next step? And then? And then? How does the end of class look?

Use the textbook to prepare for class. Each lesson is laid out for you to open, conduct, and close class. Bring you’re style and flair to it but don’t re-create the wheel. After all, the students can see the textbook as well...

Once you’ve understood the flow of the class lesson ahead of you, write yourself an outline in a markdown file, pen & paper, or even on the whiteboard. Once you have this, breathe. You got this!
