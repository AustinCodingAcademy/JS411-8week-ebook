## What

* In-Class Hackathon to build a Hacker News Clone with the Algolia API.

* Groups of 3 - 4

* Architecture: 4 Components passing props

* Plan It => Build It => Evaluate It => Host It

## Why

* Need to internalize how to plan an app, visualize the needs and building blocks.

* Learn to read docs on their own.

* Work as a team.

* Organize on Trello and Git Branches

## How

* Divide the groups by partnering students by strengths.

* Require them to create a Trello board meanwhile one student can build a repo.

* Let them lead the planning but make sure they all have a plan before setting off.

* Let them lead their groups and mentor only when they ask.
