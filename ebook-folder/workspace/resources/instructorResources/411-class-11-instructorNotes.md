## Tips For Teaching: Learning Styles & Learning Patterns

In academia, there are terms that describe ways of teaching and learning. Two of them are [Differentiated Learning](https://resilienteducator.com/classroom-resources/examples-of-differentiated-instruction/) and [Learning Styles](https://www.literacyplanet.com/au/news/engage-7-types-learners-classroom/). They are normally explained and taught as a one-to-one relationship, i.e. if you have a “Physical or Kinesthetic” learner you should only give them active and objective challenges. Humans are **not** as straightforward as this so here we’ll layout a practical way to apply these methodologies which will promote learning in your class and help you feel more accomplished as a teacher.

There are seven types of learning styles:

- [ ] Auditory & Musical

- [ ] Visual & Spatial

- [ ] Verbal

- [ ] Logical & Mathematical

- [ ] Physical or Kinesthetic

- [ ] Social & Interpersonal

- [ ] Solitary & Intrapersonal

Each of these learning styles represents a different mode of accepting information and transforming it into personal knowledge. Some people learn best in a solitary environment by asking introspective questions while others learn better by interacting socially; still, others prefer a traditional lecture. People have their preferences but all people utilize all learning styles to various degrees. What this means is that people have a *preferred* way of learning or a *default* learning style but that they will **also** engage and benefit from the other “less preferred” styles of learning.

Each student is different and they each have their *preferred* modes of learning and their *preferred* patterns of learning styles, i.e. 1st Visual, 2nd Verbal, 3rd Solitary, 4th Physical, etc. In order to fully engage with each student, the lessons in the textbook were created using a Differentiated Instruction pattern. That is to say, each lesson approaches all concepts with different teaching methods that align with each of the different learning styles. 

By learning to approach your students with these learning styles in mind you can better meet your students where they are and how they need instruction. Start by:

- [ ] Ask your students and yourself to take this [Learning Style Assessment](http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml)

- [ ] Refer to the [Section-By-Section Breakdown](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1taqpEyHlTKobZy-8lSfm-92S64zURyzYi83umkzhRkI/edit?usp=sharing) while studying the textbook.

- [ ] Read these articles on [Differentiated Learning](https://resilienteducator.com/classroom-resources/examples-of-differentiated-instruction/) and [Learning Styles](https://www.literacyplanet.com/au/news/engage-7-types-learners-classroom/) to better understand how people vary in their learning needs and how you can serve them more fully.
