# Instructor Notes: ASK MORE OF YOUR STUDENTS

You are no doubt the instructor of the class! This means, among many things, that students will look to you as the source of truth. They will seek guidance and help from you. This is a powerful relationship and one you must exercise grace, kindness, strength, and leadership because you are not only here to teach them a programming language or how to program but also how to think critically and how to creatively problem solve! To think in these critical and creative ways the student will have to learn how to seek answers on their own - the Socratic method!

A few techniques you could use in class go as follows:

## Answer questions with questions

Pause before you respond and turn the question back to the student in a way that points them in a line of thinking that may help them arrive at the answer.

1. “Yes, but is that an argument or a parameter?”

1. “What’s the goal of this function?”

1. “Why do you think that error is occurring?”

## Student-to-Student Assistance

Once you’ve realized a student or two has understood the concept another student is asking about pair them together so they can see and hear it from another mind. This is an incredibly effective strategy but you must be careful not to overdo it because it can start to have negative effects on the “questioning” student if they are always partnered with the “knowing” student.

## Questions for Student-Led Discussion

Every lesson has a section of questions over the homework. It’s intended to be a springboard for discussion among the class. Make sure to prepare for this before class by know the answer to these questions and preparing your own questions for the students.

## Word of Caution

**These recommendations come with a word of caution!** In the beginning, your students will have lower confidence in their abilities because they are in unknown territory. At this stage when they ask questions you will have to find a balance of answering the questions directly and teaching them how to find the answer. Of course, as they progress through the program they will achieve newer levels of confidence that will allow you to urge them to find more and more of their own answers!
