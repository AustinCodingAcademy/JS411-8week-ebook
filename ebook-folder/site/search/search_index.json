Coupling their back-end server with their front-end app to complete their full-stack web app Capstone Project. While this course will incorporate the skills learned in 211 and 311, the main focus is for students to learn a particular library, React, for building dynamic front-end web apps. Students will use the last two weeks of this course to complete their Capstone Project app with the guidance of their instructor. Class Structure and Expectations This class will follow a Flipped-Classroom methodology. This means you, the student, are required to complete the assigned Pre-Homework before each day of class. You will not succeed in this course if you don't complete the Pre-Homework. Working on the Pre-Homework during class takes away from other students, ruins your chance to deeply understand the material, and ask import questions! Don't be the guy! Due dates : Homework is due the Sunday after it is assigned. (unless otherwise specified). Please have your assignment turned in by the end of Sunday night. Due dates are scheduled on Sunday for you to attend Study Sessions on the weekend. GET IT DONE! Both Daily and Checkpoint Assignments are due the Sunday after they are assigned, the Submission Due Day , i.e. Ticket-Counter is assigned Wednesday and will be due for submission 4 days later on Sunday. Assignments turned in after the Submission Due Day will be penalized with -20 points, in other words, only a maximum grade of 80 is possible. The third Checkpoint for each course, (101 - 411) will be due the Sunday following the last day of the course. Work turned in after this will be subject to -20 penalty. The Final Submission Day for any late assignments is the Second Sunday after each course ends. Assignments turned in after the Final Submission Day will receive an automatic grade of 50. Homework submission : Turn in your homework on Campus Manager. Copy/paste a link to your completed assignment(GitHub Pull Request or repo URL) in the designated spot for the assignment. For assignments that cannot be accessed via link, we'll make other arrangements on a case-by-case basis. Homework guidelines : Your work should be thorough and demonstrate an understanding of the topic and tasks set forth. Please make sure that your assignments are detailed with comments, inclusive of all specifications, and complete. Grading : You Instructor will be grading your assignments based on their functionality and completion of the specifications laid out for each assignment. Late policy : You may receive up to a 70 for an assignment that is turned in late. It is up to you, the student, to request the instructor grade the assignment after you have submitted it. Additionally, if you have 3 late or missing assignments in a row, you'll be asked to read a programming-related article of your choice and make a 3-minute presentation about it to the class. Exceptions : If you need to turn in an assignment late or will be tardy/absent to a class please email your Instructor and Campus Director ahead of time to make appropriate arrangements.

Interviewing for development jobs is tough! To prepare you for the challenges ahead we will practice whiteboarding in front of the class every day. Think of it as a warm-up for the project that awaits. The whiteboarding challenges should be taken seriously and practiced even outside of class. Help yourself by following these steps to attack the problem, work through the problem and collaborate with your interviewer (instructor): How to Solve Your Challenge Restate the question aloud. Write the question out at the top of the whiteboard. Ask any clarifying questions you need. Invoke the function and write out the expected output given the sample input. If none is given, make it up. Write out a code plan to the side of the whiteboard. Speak aloud every thought you have. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART! Build the structure of your function(s). Slowly work through your code plan, building the steps you need. Don't be afraid to mess up and say it aloud. It's not about finding the solution. It's about collaborating and working toward a solution! After you finish, take a picture and transfer it to a Repl.it when you get home. Steps to Whiteboarding Success Restate, rewrite, and clarify the question Write the expected return given the input Make a code plan and speak aloud with your interviewers/team Test and come up with edge cases Revise if you can for efficiency The Prompts Class 1 Prompt 1: none - No whiteboard training the first day. Class 2 Prompt 1: Largest-Smallest - How do you find the largest and smallest number in an unsorted integer array? Class 3 Prompt 1: sumPairs - How do you find all pairs of an integer array whose sum is equal to a given number? 1 2 3 const arr = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 32 , 0 , - 16 , 8 ] sumPairs ( arr , 16 ) // --> [[8, 8], [14, 2], [0, 16], [1, 15], [32, -16]] Class 4 Prompt 1: areAnagrams - How do you check if two strings are anagrams of each other?

Class 6 Prompt 1: Binary Search - How is a binary search tree implemented? Class 7 Prompt 1: Counting Nodes - How do you count the number of leaf nodes in a given binary tree? Class 8 Prompt 1: Reverse Word In-Place - How do you reverse words in a given sentence without using any library method? ```javascript const word = 2 const sentence = 'My cat was a dog and ran away.' 1 2 3 4 const reverseWord = (arg1, arg2) => {} reverseWord(sentence, word) // returns 'saw' ``` Class 9 Prompt 1: Bucket Sort - How do you implement a bucket sort algorithm? Class 10 Prompt 1: Counting Sort - How do you implement a counting sort algorithm? Do it. Class 11 Prompt 1: New Team Member - Break into groups and describe how the Redux-Dashboard app works as if you're introducing a new team member to the source code. Your instructor will act as the your \"new team member\". 20 mins and then we'll come back to do it as a class. Class 12 Prompt 1: No Temp Swap - How do you swap two numbers without using a third variable?

Overview Whoa, you've done a lot! Already you've learned the core mindset and techniques of React which includes a new language, JSX!! Congratulation! In the past few lessons you've learned how to fetch data, store it in state, and rendering it for the human user\u2019s eyes using someone else's codebase, React. During that time you've learned how to merge our understanding of programming in JavaScript with the layout and styling of HTML and CSS. We've been working hard! But now it's time to dig a little deeper and figure out how to use some of the statements we learned last week to render certain elements based on conditions that we get in our applications. Conditional Rendering Using Local State Below is a snippet of code that should be very easy for you to read. Simple If/Else Statement 1 2 3 4 5 if ( isVerified ) { return \"is verified\" } else { return \"not verified\" } This is simple and straightforward JavaScript. We'll now just apply the same logic with React. After all, when we're developing in React we're writing JavaScript! If/Else Statement in React 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 import React , { Component } from 'react' const MyConditionalComponent = ( props ) => { if ( props . isVerified ) { return < IsVerifiedComponent userId = { props . id } /> } else { return < NotVerifiedComponent userId = { props . id } /> } } Above we see that if the user is verified, (prop.isVerified = true) then we can render a component that might welcome the user like the <IsVerifiedComponent /> , else we can render a component that tells them that their login failed and ask them to try again in the <NotVerifiedComponent /> . All of that was based on the values that are in the props object. We can do the same thing with state! Follow along with the comments throughout the code snippet to understand this for yourself.

Each of these buttons have a built-in property called onClick . We then assign the onClick method to this.props.revealClick which then points back to the original method we built: handleClick . In short, when the button is clicked it sends data back up to its parent components to change the value of this.state.isHidden . In turn, when the state changes, React will re-render and we'll get a new view because MyConditionalClass has a conditional rendering if/else statement in it. You will be using this for your next few projects so read back over it and make sure you got it!

When we .map() over an array in React we must provide the callback function an index for its second argument. The reason we have to do this is that React works to make our app fast and efficient by watching the actual DOM and comparing it to the virtual DOM. To do this it needs to have a way to identify one instance of a component from another. When we give the callback function an index we are giving React the chance to apply a unique individual value to each of the nodes that will be created in the DOM tree by each instance of the component. The value we give it is called a key . To give each of our items in the array a unique and individual key we assign it the value of the index in the callback function of the .map() method. Mapping - Key & Index .map Example with key i as 2nd argument ```javascript const todos = [{title: \"Feed Dog\", status: \"red\"}, {title: \"Walk Dog\", status: \"yellow\"}, {title: \"Pet Dog\", status: \"green\"}] const todoItems = todos.map((item, i) => return ( {item.title} ) ); ``` Above we see an example of using the index of the item in the array as the key, represented as i . This is not the preferred way but is the fall-back option if you don't have another way to assign unique keys . If the items come with id keys we could assign the key to item.id or even item.email instead. All that matters to React is that each element has a unique key so it can do its job of updated and rendering what, when, and where. Note: See how we assigned the className to the status of the todo item. This is JSX syntax that means the same as class name in HTML. Map Over & Render Data Practice It Continuing with the Todo app you built last class, you're going to pull out the pieces that represent each todo into a separate component. Then you will map over state and pass to each instance of the component the props they need to render the todo item, the delete button, the edit button and the urgency status. Instructions Before you get going make sure you install this most wonderful VS Code Extension: Simple React Snippets . Continue with the app you built in the first class of 411. Make a code plan through whiteboarding what you need to do. The todoList component should map over the this.state.todos and return a todoItem component for each todo in the array. The todoItem should be passed props that include handlers like: handleClick , handleChange , handleEdit . The todoItem should have a state that maintains the urgency status that holds the values of green , yellow or red . The todoItem component should render the background-color of the text based on the status of the item. At the end your Todo list should look the same but function differently with the exception of the status colors.

Overview Now that we have a grip on this passing props stuff let's take a deeper look at that state stuff in Class-based Components . As you saw in the last lesson we were able to pass the values in a parent component's state down to its child component through props . But what is state ? Where does it get its values? When is it created? In this lesson, we'll address all of those questions. State (Local Memory) According to the React Docs , state is locally-scoped memory , which means that it is only available to the component that it is initialized in unless that data/memory is passed to another component via, ya know... props . The Rules of State Only class-based components can have local state . state is just a plain ole JavaScript object with key-value pairs. If state changes the component will & must re-render. state can only be updated with the this.setState() method which takes an object {} as its sole argument. setState() compares the object you pass into the current state and changes only the values that need to change. Again, state updates are merged which means setState() compares the object of state and the object passed into it before it makes changes and only changes what needs to be changed. This is why this.state can only be changed with the setState() method. The changes of state follow a pattern of data flow called a top-down or unidirectional data flow. Data flows downward . This means that state is always owned by some specific parent component, and any data or UI components derived from that state can only affect components below them in the tree. See It - State Overview: Fetch, Store, and Render Data Fetch Data w/Axios + componentDidMount Map Over & Render Data Render Functional Components + Styling Practice It - State + Props The homework is going to require you to code on your own a little more than usual. Why? Because the concepts of React are functional programming concepts and require doing to understand them.

It may seem like a flurry of information but the more you practice this stuff the easier it will get. Always keep looking up React documentation and tutorials to guide you along. Today let's talk about using forms in React. Forms are what you will build over and over again in your career! You've seen and used forms in HTML. They're pretty simple and easy to use. A form that takes someone's name looks like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 < form > < label > Name: < input type = \"text\" name = \"name\" /> </ label > < input type = \"submit\" value = \"Submit\" /> </ form > In HTML, the elements like: <input> , <textarea> , and <select> handle their own state, but in React we want state to be handled in our component\u2019s local state.

A form that takes someone's name looks like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 < form > < label > Name: < input type = \"text\" name = \"name\" /> </ label > < input type = \"submit\" value = \"Submit\" /> </ form > In HTML, the elements like: <input> , <textarea> , and <select> handle their own state, but in React we want state to be handled in our component\u2019s local state.

Overview: Replace Class-based with Functional + Hooks We've been learning React through Class-based Components but we're now going to switch them out for Functional components. And instead of using Lifecycle methods, we'll use things called Hooks. That being said . . . why use React Hooks? Well . . . because it allows us to use things like state in our functional components. When we say \"state\" here we mean local component state. Not global app state created by Redux. React Hooks What are Hooks? They are simple pieces of React code that were added in 2018, to great fanfare among React developers. As we mentioned above, they allow you to use \"state\" in functional components ( not class-based components ). This promotes code cleanliness, only pure functional components, as well, code performance. The best way to learn about it is to just dive right in so we will look at an example. The following is an example taken directly from the React website . Take a look at it and see if you can identify what looks different about it than the other React components you've seen and built. Functional ExampleComponent.js 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 import React , { useState } from 'react' ; function ExampleComponent () { // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call `count` with an initial value of `0` const [ count , setCount ] = useState ( 0 ); return ( < div > < p > You clicked { count } times < /p> < button onClick = {() => setCount ( count + 1 )} > Click me < /button> < /div> ); } export default ExampleComponent So what's happening in the component above? Well the first thing we notice is that we are importing the hook called useState from React . You can see that being used on the first line of the component. In fact, that's the only other line we need to talk about. If you remember, you can declare two variables at once using array destructuring and that's exactly what's happening here with [count, setCount] . Count will represent the value of state you want to use. Using regular state, it would look like this: Class-Based ExampleComponent.js Equivalent 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 import React , { Component } from 'react' class ExampleComponent extends React { constructor ( props ) { super ( props ) this . state = { count : 0 } } setCount = () => { this . setState ({ count : count + 1 }) } render () { return ( < div > < p > You clicked { this . state . count } times < /p> < button onClick = { this . setCount ()} > Click me < /button> < /div> ) } } export default ExampleComponent You'll notice that we set the count equal to 0 . The way that happened with React Hooks was on the fifth line of the first snippet, which reads useState(0) . The useState function is called with the initial value you want to set to a variable, in this case, count . So there's only one part left and that's the setCount variable. That variable represents a function and you call it when you want to change that particular piece of state! If we wanted to change the count to 1 we would write setCount(1) somewhere in the component. You can see an example of this in the button's onClick method. <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}> , line 10. Pretty simple stuff right? There are other hooks like useEffect that exist but we won't dive into those right now. We simply wanted to bring this to your attention because we know that you'll encounter it on your path to becoming front-end developers. One main place that you'll see Hooks used is in the Material-UI documentation (coming up in a couple of class lessons). Typically, when an update as popular as this happens, people start integrating it as quickly as possible. Why Functional over Class-based Why did we learn Class-based and now have to replace them? Class-based & Functional components have been part of React since React's inception, May 29, 2013. Accept back then, Class-based components were previously the only way to manage component state because you could create this.state = {} in a class. With the advent of Hooks, introduced in React v16.8, we can now manage component state in Functional components. Because of this new way of component state management, the memory efficiency of Functional components, less boilerplate code, and cleanliness of the code developers now favor Functional components with hooks when writing new code. This being said, legacy code-bases will have both and you'll need to know how to read and write each. Here is a scenario that demonstrates a use case for why developers favor functional components with hooks. Let's say last week you made this simple display component. Functional Component of App.js 1 2 3 4 5 import React from 'react' function App () { return < h1 > Simple Functional Component < /h1> } Now we've been asked to add some component state to toggle between visible and hidden statuses. Before hooks we would have to go through the process and convert it to a Class-based component then add a constructor() , super() , this.state={} , then create values to hold the state, plus passing in an object the the method...blah blah blah. With Hooks, we can keep our component as a Function by simply adding in one of the hooks, known as useState then handling the click with a custom build method: State management using the useState Hook of App.js 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 import React , { useState } from 'react' ; function App () { const [ isHidden , setIsHidden ] = useState ( false ); const handleClick = () => { let status = isHidden === true ? false : true setIsHidden ( status ); } return ( < div > < p > The Status of hidden is { isHidden } < /p> < h1 onClick = { handleClick } > Functional Component Using State < /h1> < /div>; ) } Above useState() is a hook (just a function) imported from React that returns two values: a state value and a method(or, function) to change that state value. We hold these two items in variables ( that's what you see on line 4: const [isHidden, setIsHidden] ). These two variables are defined by us, the developer. We could call them const [isClicked, setClickedValue] or anything else we want as long as it makes sense for what value they hold and change. The syntax may look funny to you but it's just array destructuring. Using array destructuring we hold the values of what's returned from useState() as [isHidden, setIsHidden] to hold the value of state and create a method to change that value, respectively. When setIsHidden is called it will update isHidden with whatever argument is passed to setIsHidden . See line 8 in the above example. Are Class-based Components Being Replaced? From the get go, you've been learning React through Class-based components so you can manage component state. Now we're asking you to switch to Functional components and use this new thing called Hooks instead of lifecycle methods and state. This may be frustrating but remember, React is the foremost front-end library in the world with wide adoption. Because of this, many applications are built with it. In the beginning of React, the only way to manage component state was through the use of Class-based components. Because of this you will likely see them in legacy code bases, Google searches, code examples on StackOverflow and equivalent forums. In the end it is important to know both because, the React development team has said they have no plans to remove Class-based components. Converting Class-based to Functional Under the hood both Class-based components and functional components work exactly the same with DOM changes based on the state reference in memory. The examples below show the conversion of code from Class-based component to Functional Component using a hook to manage state. The Class-based Way 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 // MyConditionalComponent.js import React , { Component } from 'react' class MyConditionalComponent extends Component { constructor ( props ) { super ( props ) this . state = { isHidden : true } } handleClick = () => { let status = this . state . isHidden == true ? false : true this . setState ({ isHidden : status }) } render () { return ( < div > < h1 onClick = { this . handleClick } > Functional Component Using State < /h1> < /div> ) } } The Functional Component Way 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 // MyConditionalComponent.js import React , { useState } from 'react' ; function App () { const [ isHidden , setIsHidden ] = useState ( false ); const handleClick = () => { let status = isHidden == true ? false : true setIsHidden ( status ); } return < h1 onClick = { handleClick } > Functional Component Using State < /h1>; } With Comments 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 // MyConditionalComponent.js // Instead of importing the { Component }, let's import the { useState } hook import React , { Component } from 'react' // No need to build a class, let's just keep it as a function: function App() { class MyConditionalComponent extends Component { // since it's not a class it doesn't need a constructor constructor ( props ) { // since it's not extending the React Component there's no need to call super() super ( props ) // we can store the value of state and the function to update it with destructuring instead of a state object: const [isHidden, setIsHidden] = useState(false); this . state = { isHidden : true } } handleClick = () => { // with a functional component we don't have state so need for all the extra member operators (.) : let status = isHidden == true ? false : true let status = this . state . isHidden == true ? false : true // now, we don't need to pass an object to setState, instead, just use the function you defined earlier: setIsHidden(status); this . setState ({ isHidden : status }) } render () { return ( < div > < h1 onClick = { this . handleClick } > Functional Component Using State < /h1> < /div> ) } } Take some time to compare these two components. They accomplish the exact same thing but use different syntax to do it. useEffect Instead of componentDidMount and other lifecycle methods we now just have one hook called useEffect that does it all. When useEffect has an empty dependency array [] it behaves just like componentDidMount . The Functional Component Way 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 // MyFunctionTodos.js import React , { useState , useEffect } from 'react' ; function MyFunctionTodos () { const [ arrayOfTodos , setArrayOfTodos ] = useState ([]); useEffect (() => { fetch ( 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos' ) . then ( response => { return response . json () }) // update state with setArrayOfTodos . then ( todos => setArrayOfTodos ( todos )) }, []); // <-- when dependency array is empty... // ...it works just like componentDidMount() return ( < div > { arrayOfTodos . map (( todo , index ) => { return < li key = { index } > { todo . title } < /li> })} < /div> ); } We can run code when state is updated too. Below we have an isCountEven function that runs when count is updated and the useEffect hook is checking for that update in the dependency [count] array. useEffect() update 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 // MyCountComponent.js import React , { useState , useEffect } from 'react' ; function MyCountComponent () { const [ count , setCount ] = useState ( 1 ); useEffect (() => { // useEffect takes in anonymous function let isCountEven = () => { if ( count % 2 === 0 ){ console . log ( \"yes count is even\" , count ); } } isCountEven (); }, [ count ]); // dependency array will only run when `count` changes const handleClick = () => { let newCount = count + setCount ( newCount ); } return < h1 onClick = { handleClick } > { `You clicked ${ count } times` } < /h1>; } See It - Components with Hooks The accompanying Scotch.io/DigitalOcean Tutorial In the future, many videos & examples in pre-class lessons and some assignment work use Class-based components and have you'll have to know the Functional and Hook equivalent and be able to convert them your self. Practice It Part 1 Below is a simple CodePen with a Class-based Component. Check out how the code works, what the app is doing, and then convert it to a Functional Component to make the app function the exact same way. Convert Class To Functional component with Hooks Part 2 Import { useState } on the first line next to React Initialize the variables like in the example above. You will want a count and setCount with the default value being 0 Create an <h3> that displays the current count Create a button that uses setCount on its onClick method to change the count Additional Resources Medium, Dan Abramov - Hooks YT, Fireship - 10 React Hooks Explained YT, ReactConf - Dan Abramov: React 90% Cleaner Blog, sarah_chima@dev.to - Array Destructuring Know Your Docs React Docs - Hooks","title":"Functional Components and Hooks"},{"location":"module-1/functionalComponentHooks/#functional-components-with-hooks","text":"Trust the process.","title":"Functional Components with Hooks"},{"location":"module-1/functionalComponentHooks/#overview-replace-class-based-with-functional-hooks","text":"We've been learning React through Class-based Components but we're now going to switch them out for Functional components.

Create it.\u2003\u2014George Bernard Shaw Recap At this point in your journey, you should have learned the basic building blocks of web development (HTML/CSS) as well as how to use JavaScript (specifically Node.js) to create your own web server and APIs. Now it's time to learn how to build the front-end of your applications in a professional, dynamic way! It should be noted that you can build front-ends with multiple libraries or frameworks including Angular 8+ , Ember , and Vue , but in this course we're going to learn to build with React . Learning this library will give you experience with a well-known and popular library, prime you for hiring in the start-up and corporate tech scene, as well as teach you skills to pick up and learn other libraries and frameworks as your career progresses. Overview Let's start with what React is. It's a library, a codebase you can import & use. More specifically it's a front-end library just like Vue.js or Angular.js or Backbone.js and so on. It's a library that we can use to speed up the development of our app as well as address performance issues and maintain a composable structure and most importantly, MAKE DEVELOPMENT MORE FUN! We'll break each of these down ahead. Read It - What's React? React was created by Facebook as a solution to a few problems: When something in the DOM changes the entire page must re-render. Go to any site that doesn't use React and you will see that this can take a while, especially if you are viewing the site with a mobile device. Turns out, most people view Facebook with mobile phones. As the internet connectivity in the United States is limited to 3G, 4G, and LTE data transmission, Facebook wanted faster page rendering to ensure people continued using their platform. Remember the 2016 presidential election? Facebook was able to get more people tuned into their platform than common media outlets because they had faster page renderings. How does it solve the faster rendering? It maintains a virtual DOM. That is to say, it keeps a JavaScript object that represents the DOM, then compares what has been changed in the virtual DOM to the actual DOM and only changes pieces of the actual DOM that changed instead of the entire thing! Notice how Facebook has MANY, MANY elements displaying news feeds, images, videos, friends, and ads. This becomes hard to maintain for each user. Think about it! Each user's page looks entirely different from the next. How do they do it? With React! They can create reusable components that take in data and can be rendered or not rendered on the page depending on the type of data they take in. This allows for data to be in control of what's rendered and when rather than the browser rendering and simply displaying the data. This is where it gets really cool! In Web 101 you learned how to structure a web page with HTML and style it with CSS. You learned how to manipulate data in JS211 and learned common programming patterns. With React you will be able to use those HTML elements inside the JavaScript you write while injecting CSS to style it . . . ALL IN THE SAME FILE, while also programming what is rendered and when. This, you see, is called JSX . Now we get to composable structure . Composable structure in our code allows us to build multiple pieces of our app in separate files and then call them, like functions, in the main part of our app if/when we need them! If you haven't picked up already, functions are just recipes that are built and laid out ready to be used. They are not used until they are called. In React, we can lay out functions that return HTML, CSS and JS to be used if/when we need them. Lastly, React is really fun to build with! No longer are you stuck using all the DOM methods like .getElementById() and .innerHTML() . React itself uses these under-the-hood, you use one of them and from then on you don't have to think about the DOM methods. Simply write JavaScript and render what you want, when you want and how you want! How Does React Work? There are a couple of pieces we'll cover first then you can start putting it all together for yourself. Functional Components Functional Component are just that, components that can be called just like normal JavaScript functions. Let's say you had a page like YouTube and all the videos that showed up in your search results for \"hamsters on piano\" included videos you have already seen. If you wanted to display to the user their previously watched videos with a banner that says, \"you watched this on dd/mm/yyyy\" you could do that with a functional component. You would build the functional component to show the video and title that shows up in the search results. Then the component could query your history and if it matches any of your history it could use an if/else statement to display the banner if you had watched it or not if you haven't watched it. Let's look at a simpler example for right now. In the component below we're going to build a button in a functional component that will display either \"Was button clicked? true\" or \"Was button clicked? false\" based on whether the button was clicked or not. We'll call this component in a parent component that will hold the state of the button, isClicked: false . We'll then pass the state of the button back to the child component, MyFirstComponent.js via props. Check it out. MyFirstComponent.js 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 // because React is a library we have to call the functionality of it we want to use. // To do this we will always have to write the following line at the top of our .js file to save the functionality to a variable import React from 'react' ; // simply write a function in ES6+ then pass in the keyword props to access this special object const myFirstComponent = ( props ) => { // every component in React MUST return something... return ( < button > Was button clicked ? { props . wasClicked } < /button> ) } // Then, because we want to compose our web pages with composable elements, we have to export the code in the file. Always write this line at the end of your .js files: export default myFirstComponent without Comments 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 // MyFirstComponent.js import React from 'react' ; const myFirstComponent = ( props ) => { return ( < button > Was button clicked ? { props . wasClicked } < /button> ) } export default myFirstComponent Class-Based Components pt.1 Now let's see what a class-based component looks like. Because we need to hold the state of our button and create a method to take the input of the onClick of the button, we'll need to make our parent component of this button a class-based component. This is important. Most components you build will be functional, but as you learn that it needs to hold state or have methods, you'll then change them over to be these class-based components. Check it out . . . MyFirstClassComponent.js 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 // Again import React to use it but this time we have to destructure it and get to the \"Component\" key import React , { Component } from 'react' // We can also import code we've already built into these class-based components import myFirstComponent from './MyFirstComponent' // Notice here we use that \"extends\" word on the \"Component\" we imported? class MyFirstClassComponent extends Component { // All Classes must have a \"constructor\", in React we always pass \"props\" constructor ( props ) { // Remember that if we \"extend\" a \"class\" of a \"class\" we have to call the \"super()\" method. Just pass it \"props\" as well. super ( props ); // Class-based Components allow us to have \"state\"! And this is why/when we use class-based components. this . state = { text : '' , todos : [], isClicked : false }; // Class-based components also allow us to have methods attached to them onChange = e => { this . setState ({ text : e . target . value }) } // Class-based components must have the \"render()\" method in them for React to call them as an IIFE (immediately invoked function expression) render () { // and the \"render()\" method must have a return return ( < div > < h1 > Input Text Below < /h1> < input value = { this . state . text } onChange = { this . onChange } /> { /* We can make comment in JSX like this, with curlies outside our comment tokens*/ } { /* We can invoke myFirstComponent here to use it in this component and pass it information via \"props\"*/ } < myFirstComponent wasClicked = { this . state . isClicked } /> < /div> ) } } export default MyFirstClassComponent without Comments 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 // MyFirstClassComponent.js import React , { Component } from 'react' ; import myFirstComponent from './MyFirstComponent' class MyFirstClassComponent extends Component { constructor ( props ) { super ( props ); this . state = { text : '' , todos : [], isClicked : false }; onChange = e => { this . setState ({ text : e . target . value }) } render () { return ( < div > < h1 > Input Text Below < /h1> < input value = { this . state . text } onChange = { this . onChange } /> < myFirstComponent wasClicked = { this . state . isClicked } /> < /div> ) } } export default MyFirstClassComponent You can see that our button element, myFirstComponent , is called in our parent component's render() method and we pass it the prop: wasClicked which is pointing at the parent component's state object, isClicked . Then if you scroll back up and look at the myFirstComponent code you'll see we can display the state by placing the props.wasClicked inside curly braces {} : {props.wasClicked} . Take some time to make sure you have some general grasp of the way these are threaded together. Pretty simple right? Cool! BIG NOTES you MUST remember: Each component can & must only return ONE parent element. This means if you want an <h1/> , <p/> and a <button/> element to be returned from a component it must be wrapped in a parent element like a <div/> or <article/> . This is a hard and fast rule you must follow when developing with React. Class-based components must start with a capital letter!!!! You know this from JS211 about classes. It still applies here. Don't forget it or you'll be chasing the same bug every day. Title your file names the same as your components. This is the standard way of doing it. You don't have to include .js in your import statements as long as it is a .js file. If it's anything else, .ts , .css , .html , or anything else, you still have to put the file type. But JavaScript files don't have to be declared, React makes js assumptions for you. Though we'll be starting with Class-Based components as a way to get us into the mindset of developing with React it's important to know that Functional Components using Hooks to manage component state has become the norm and preferred technique circa 2019-2020+. Most apps have one and only one class-based component.

It's so simple and easy to use that you'll memorize all the life cycle methods and understand state and props and then you won't want to build with anything else. Today is going to be a whirlwind of facts and concepts. We're going to cover all the things that makeup React. It'll be tough at first because it's a lot! And it's new to you. But rest assured, you will get enough practice with it in the coming weeks that all of it will sink in and you'll be proud to put React on your resume! Overview Recall that React is a tool that helps us build composable websites and apps. This composable structure is the center-point to the whole mindset behind React. Each of the pieces on a website, the smaller components that make up the whole, are just that components . In 101 you were used to building the components of a web page with various HTML tags: <article></article> , <p></p> , etc. Each of these elements represented a small piece of the whole page. With React we build functions that return these same elements. We call these functions React Components . The reason we build them as functions is that we might need to use the same element for an unknown amount of times with different data inside of it. For example, on Facebook you have a page to view all of your friends. Each of your friends has different information but they are still displayed on the same element/piece/component with the same shape and styling. Furthermore, you may have 6000 friends and I may only have 500. Using functions, the React app build by Facebook will call the FriendComponent function 6000 times when you look at your friends and 500 times when I look at my friends. To make this work we need a way to pass unique data to each function call so that each function call will return the same HTML element but render the unique data we pass to it. This passing of data happens with something called props as in prop erties. You see, this props parameter will represent the properties of the element that is returned from the React Component (function) Props (How we pass data in React) Below you'll see a code snippet of a couple React components (again, which are simple JavaScript functions!). The only thing that makes them \"React\" functions is that they can be passed to the much larger React function that ingests them and turns them into HTML elements on a web page, known as React Elements . Just like functions, they can take arguments between their () . In fact, this is the only way we can pass props . To use the available props we must pass the props keyword into the () of the component. ChildComponent.js 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 const ChildComponent = ( props ) => { return ( < h1 > `A ${ props . propOne } tastes like ${ props . propTwo } .` < /h1> ) } export default ChildComponent In the above example, you see the props keyword passed into the function as an argument right? Now, where does the data associated with that props keyword come from? Look what's going on here: ParentComponent.js 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 class ParentComponent extends Component { constructor () { super (); render () { < ChildComponent propOne = { \"I'm a \" } propTwo = { \"Cutie Pie :)\" } /> } } In the code snippet above you see that our first ChildComponent is called inside our ParentComponent . Notice the JSX syntax: When we call a component in React with JSX it looks a lot like HTML syntax? In the line where we call the ChildComponent we see there are two props given: propOne and propTwo . They look a lot like attributes of an HTML tag, no? This is how we pass props down to other components. We can give them any attribute name we want. That same functionality could have been written: <ChildComponent poop={\"I'm a \"} unicorn={\"Cutie Pie :)\"}/> ; but instead we choose useful attribute/property names. Let's see it with state now. In the code snippet below we see the ParentComponent now has a state object, a simple JavaScript object with key and value pairs. Then we see the ChildComponent is called and passed props that reference keys of the state object. In this way, we can pass local state to another piece/component of our application!!

After that, we use the props keyword in the child component, and presto! You have a component using props !! If we rendered ChildComponent it would say: \"A fig newton tastes like garbage.\" Under-the-hood, the props object would look like this: 1 2 3 4 props = { pieceOne : 'fig newton' , pieceTwo : 'garbage' } If you wanted to console.log() the value of the pieceOne key you would: console.log(props.pieceOne) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 const ChildComponent = ( props ) => { console . log ( props . pieceOne ) return ( < h1 > `A ${ this . props . propOne } tastes like ${ this . props . propTwo } .` < /h1> ) } Hopefully, that makes sense.

As I am sure we can all guess, authentication is used to lock down specific endpoints so that they cannot be freely accessed. To learn how to implement authentication, we will need to understand the process or workflow as well as a few new terms. Although we will be building our back-end server with Google Firebase , it is important to understand the fundamentals of core authentication. There are many ways to implement authentication, but we will be discussing one of the more commonly used methods, JSON Web Token/JWT authentication. This requires our front-end app to communicate with a back-end server by sending some authentication data, i.e. username and password . Once the request is received, the server checks the database for the user and compares the password, if they match, the server generates a unique authentication token and sends it back to the front-end app in the response . Once received, the front-end app stores into cookies . This token, will then be appended to any request made by the user (front-end app) to get protected/private data from the server. There are a few more details in there like how's is the token generated and what is cookies and how is a cookie appended to a request but that's the main gist. In this lesson we'll cover all of it so you have a clear understanding about how authentication works. Let's get started! Why Authenticate? Authentication is used by a server to give permission to a user based on the credentials they have provided. Without implementing some type of authentication to a server, the server can be exposed to data that we otherwise did not want to expose. Also, it allows anyone the ability to send multiple requests to routes that have been built, and that can lead to many problems such as database storage capacity exceeding certain limits, and storing data is not cheap. There is a lot of malicious intent surrounding cyber security, so making sure we set up some layer of protection is a must. It's important to understand authentication because it's necessary for the security of your app and it gives you some insight on what every app on the internet does when you sign in. Authentication vs Authorization Let's first clear up the definition of these two words. Authentication is the process of verifying whether a person-user has access to an application (your server); Are they a user? It's like buying a ticket to a concert and flashing it at the gate(authentication), and you're allowed to go in and enjoy the music! ... but what's a authorization ? It's a backstage pass . Think of all the \"levels\" you can buy at a music festival: Wristband : Allows a person only access to the general floor VIP Backstage : Allows a person access to both backstage area and the floor Security Badge : Allows a person to access any area and might has additional security access Meet the Band : All-access (non-security), free drinks, and good times! Imagine these are \"Roles\" assigned to people at a concert. This is authorization who is allowed to do what. Typically in applications we have users for basic use, admin for high influence use, and a few other various roles for various levels of access. Although restrictions should apply to everyone, there is always someone trying to get in for free or trying to bypass the security. When we build apps with data that needs to be allowed to certain person-users but restricted to others, we need to implement Authorization . This is the process of assigning roles to each person-user. Maybe you're building a classroom management app for you and your students. All of the data for this app will be stored in the same database and served by the same server but you don't want your students to have access to other students' grades and turned-in assignments but still have access to their own assignments and grades. However, for you, as the teacher you want to be able to see all of the student's grades. To solve this problem you would assign each user of the app a role when they sign-up so each has specific levels of authorization. Teachers would get a teacher role, students would get a student role and maybe parents would get a parent role so they could see their child's grades but not submit assignments for them. In your Firebase project, you will be writing rules that that asks if they are a teacher to access the resources behind the getAllGrades() so that student and parent users would be blocked from this particular resource. This will allow them access using if statements asking if the current signed in user has a certain role. For example, if a teacher/user is signed in, and that teacher is trying to access all data pertaining to grades for their students, that teacher/user must have the role teacher in order to access any documents about the students grades. This will prevent the roles student and parent from seeing these particular documents, unless those particular grades refer back to the student in requesting it. We can also set rules based on a user's id . This will allow us to connect certain documents with the current user that is signed in. So if a user /student is logged in, they should only have access to their grades and will be restricted from trying to see any other type of document stored in our database. The Steps of Authentication Authentication is the process of comparing passwords to passwords to verify or authenticate the identity of a user. The username and password are sent to the server. The server accesses its database of users that holds the username and password. The server checks the provided username & password against the username & password in the database. If the credentials match, the user's identity is verified, and the application decides what's next. If not, a generic error message is returned. The Sign-Up Overview There's a difference between Sign-Up and Sign-In . We first need to Sign-Up , obviously. The first step of authentication is to sign-up! After all, we can't verify your identity if we don't have credentials to compare with what you provide to confirm you are who you say you are.... When one signs-up on any web app, their credentials (username/email & password) will be sent from the front-end to the server and written to the database. NOTE: It's important to understand this because it will help you visualize how the server will be checking incoming \"sign-in\" credentials against previously written \"sign-up\" credentials. Input and submit email/username & password info on front-end to \"sign-up\" Front-End sends POST request with the the email/username & password to the server The server receives the credentials and INSERTs a new entry in the users table The user returns to the app to login by inputting and submitting their email & password on the front-end The front-end sends a POST Request with the credentials to the server The server SELECTS the previously written email that matches and checks to see if the passwords match If true the next page in the app is sent to the front-end and a bearer token is stored in cookies (more on this soon) If false another \"login\" page is sent to the front-end Hashing There's a small step in Step 3 & 6 of the summary above that was excluded called hashing . See, when we store passwords in our database we don't want to store plaintext because if our database is ever breached(hacked) the passwords will be readable by human-eyes and simple JavaScript functions. To protect our users we create new strings that represent the passwords called a hash . A hash is a unique and complicated string created by passing a simple string into a mathematical formula (algorithm) that scrambles and generates a unique string. The way it works is highly mathematical (luckily there are Node packages for it) but in short it could look like this: MD5 Password Hashing Algorithm Simple String The Hashed String pony 4B3E3C2F99046F92A61BAB6775848577 apple 1F3870BE274F6C49B3E31A0C6728957F pony 4B3E3C2F99046F92A61BAB6775848577 No matter what, if you pass pony through this specific hashing algorithm (MD5) is will also produce the 4B3E3C2F99046F92A61BAB6775848577 every time. This is how passwords can be stored as hashes and later compared, hash to hash. We just use a hashing algorithm in the route on our server between receiving the request to \"login\" and when the server reads the previously stored hash in the database created during \"sign-up\". You can play with how the MD5 hashing algorithm will create unique strings with any common string you put in here. Once the plaintext password has been hashed the new unique String will be stored in the database along with the username/email. The Code for Hashing Below is a small Express server that has a hashing algorithm added to it called argon2 . Read over the code and see if you can make sense of what's going on. Express Server App with Argon2 Hashing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 const express = require ( \"express\" ); // import argon for hashing const argon2i = require ( \"argon2-ffi\" ). argon2i ; const crypto = require ( \"crypto\" ); const bodyParser = require ( \"body-parser\" ); // create express app const app = express (); const jsonParser = bodyParser . json (); // post request route for when a user signs up for the app app . post ( \"/signup\" , jsonParser , function ( req , res ) { // if no data has been sent, send back status 400 if ( ! req . body ) return res . sendStatus ( 400 ); // using argon2, hash the request body that has the password. crypto . randonBytes ( 32 , function ( err , salt ) { if ( err ) throw err ; argon2i . hash ( req . body . password , salt ). then (( hash ) => { // don't log in production code...for learning purposes only console . log ( hash ); //...replace with code to write the username & password to the database // then send a 201 status that it was successful. res . sendStatus ( 201 ); }); }); }); // ...more routes would go here... app . listen ( 3001 , function () { console . log ( \"listening on port 3001\" ); }); As you might have seen, when someone sends a POST request to the /signup route, it should include a username and password . If it does, the server will run the hashing function crypto.randonBytes & argon2i .hash on the password. You are probably wondering what salt is. Salt is the number of times the algorithm is supposed to run before the hash is determined \"complete\". Hackers have access to run the same algorithm that creates your password hashes. This means, if they get ahold of your list of usernames & passwords they can run them backwards as well and learn the plaintext version of your passwords and then access your user's data. Nevertheless, they will still be guessing at possible inputs to get to the correct password. To break through this barrier they will formulate something called a Brute Force attack , where in, they tell a powerful computer to run the same algorithm over and over on the list of hashed passwords attempting to get the right passwords. This is where a salt round comes in. A salt round is the number of times the algorithm scrambles the plaintext password. 1 salt = 1 time, 5 salts = 5 times. Each time you increase the salt you increase the difficulty for the hacker by a factor of about 10! By increasing this number you make it more expensive in both time and energy for the hacker to make it profitable to hack your users. The double-edge of this sword is that it also makes it more expensive for your computers to run the hashing algorithm. The trick is to find a happy medium! Usually 12 is the ideal number; but, some have suggested you calculate the number with the total amount of time you can stand . To get an idea of why salting is so important when hashing password, check out this post from 2011. Luckily, you won't have to be dealing with Express Servers, Argon 2, Hashing or Salting because you'll be using Firebase! The Sign-In Overview Now that we know passwords will be hashed on sign-up , what happens when a user signs-in? Obviously we don't want our user to have to input a username and password for every page and resource they'd like to access. Instead, we want them to have them sign-in once and then allow them to freely move around their account until they sign-off. The trouble is that our server (just a computer) doesn't know who they are like we humans would if we saw them. So, to make this work we have to give the user a \"wristband\" that they would show to each part of the server when they wanted to see a new page or resource. This \"wristband\" is called a bearer token . A bearer token , or a JSON Web Token (JWT) , is a unique set of letters and numbers created by the server the represents a successful sign-in. It's generated when username & passwords match and sent back to the client (the user) as proof of the matching username and password. It's then stored on their device so that it can be sent back to the server with each new subsequent request to see a new page or resource. In this way, the user can move freely about their account without worrying about signing-in over and over; but instead we developers just have to be smart enough to make that front-end client send the bearer token back with each new request, and make our server require a bearer token to allow the resources to be sent back with the response. Creating a JWT A JWT might look like this: 1 eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c Look closely and you'll see two \".\" periods between these random strings of letters and numbers. These separate the token into three parts: Part Name Example Definition Header eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9 includes information about the type, as in JWT, and the algorithm, alg, used to created it. Payload eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ the actual data stored in it, like the username & iat (issued at) which tells the time the token was issued. Signature SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c contains the hash of our server's key Authentication Workflow Now let's talk through the process from a high perspective. You'll be seeing code snippets as we go but just know there may be some modifications to this code in live code bases. But please read the pseudo-code so you picture, for yourself, this process. The first step in this process is that the client/front-end will make a request to a server/API: 1 2 3 4 5 // front-end app axios . get ( \"https://ourapi.com/user?ID=12345\" ). then ( function ( response ) { // handle success console . log ( response ); }); Just as a server is built to do, it will be listening for requests to that URL endpoint and return a response with the resource that was requested: 1 2 3 4 5 // back-end app(server) app . get ( \"/users\" , ( req , res ) => { // perform some logic to go get data from database res . json ( users ); }); But now we want to see if the user is registered in our server, aka authenticate them, before we let them get to the resource they want... To do this the server will ask the user to sign-in with their username and password. If they are successful with their sign-in, the server will send to them a \"wristband\", or an authorization token , that proves they have been authenticated . Now that they have been authorized , the stored token will be used on all of their following requests (until they logout) so they don't have to keep entering their username and password. This token is called a bearer token . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 // back-end const login = ( req , res ) => { const { username , password } = req . body // * build and call your own authentication function using our server's secret key const jwtSecret = 'secret123' app . get ( '/jwt' , ( req , res ) => { const token = jsonwebtoken . sign ({ user : 'username' }, jwtSecret ) // the response object has a method on it called` that takes three arguments: // * name of the cookie // * value of the cookie // * parameters of the cookie // and sets a cookie on the user's browser/client. res . cookie ( 'our_token' , token , { httpOnly : true }) res . json ({ token }) }); // -or- // * send the username & password to a third-party like Auth0, see below: axios ( `https:// ${ process . env .

But Why? This is a good question! Why do we need to send a JWT with a header, payload and signature? The answer to this question is security. Think way back to your Prep Course when we first learned about HTTP(S) and how the internet is possible because computers are all built to read the same language and use the same protocol(HTTP). This means that all information sent over wifi, fiber, coax, satellite or copper is available to all computers in-between you and the server you're talking to across the country or world. This space between you and that server or other computer is a very vulnerable space because it can be intercepted and read by many computers without you evening knowing. For this reason we have to encrypt the data we need to be private. Encryption is the act of \"scrambling\" the information in a mathematical way with a key only the sender and the receiver have. ...And this is the foundation of Cyber Security. With this in mind you might be thinking that creating your password hashes and bearer tokens is very difficult. It's actually not because we just use Node packages to generate them and we just tie them together to make them work for our app. Additional Resources Article, Tania Rascia - Client-side Authentication the Right Way (Cookies vs. Local Storage) YT, Fireship - Session vs Token Authentication in 100 Seconds YT, Ben Awad - How to Store JWT for Authentication Article, jwt.io - Introduction to JSON Web Tokens NOTE: The following videos are about setting up authentication in your Node Express Server.

As I am sure we can all guess, authentication is used to lock down specific endpoints so that they cannot be freely accessed. To learn how to implement authentication, we will need to understand the process or workflow as well as a few new terms. Although we will be building our back-end server with Google Firebase , it is important to understand the fundamentals of core authentication. There are many ways to implement authentication, but we will be discussing one of the more commonly used methods, JSON Web Token/JWT authentication. This requires our front-end app to communicate with a back-end server by sending some authentication data, i.e. username and password . Once the request is received, the server checks the database for the user and compares the password, if they match, the server generates a unique authentication token and sends it back to the front-end app in the response . Once received, the front-end app stores into cookies . This token, will then be appended to any request made by the user (front-end app) to get protected/private data from the server. There are a few more details in there like how's is the token generated and what is cookies and how is a cookie appended to a request but that's the main gist. In this lesson we'll cover all of it so you have a clear understanding about how authentication works. Let's get started!","title":"Overview"},{"location":"module-2/authentication/#why-authenticate","text":"Authentication is used by a server to give permission to a user based on the credentials they have provided. Without implementing some type of authentication to a server, the server can be exposed to data that we otherwise did not want to expose. Also, it allows anyone the ability to send multiple requests to routes that have been built, and that can lead to many problems such as database storage capacity exceeding certain limits, and storing data is not cheap. There is a lot of malicious intent surrounding cyber security, so making sure we set up some layer of protection is a must. It's important to understand authentication because it's necessary for the security of your app and it gives you some insight on what every app on the internet does when you sign in.","title":"Why Authenticate?"},{"location":"module-2/authentication/#authentication-vs-authorization","text":"Let's first clear up the definition of these two words. Authentication is the process of verifying whether a person-user has access to an application (your server); Are they a user? It's like buying a ticket to a concert and flashing it at the gate(authentication), and you're allowed to go in and enjoy the music! ... but what's a authorization ? It's a backstage pass . Think of all the \"levels\" you can buy at a music festival: Wristband : Allows a person only access to the general floor VIP Backstage : Allows a person access to both backstage area and the floor Security Badge : Allows a person to access any area and might has additional security access Meet the Band : All-access (non-security), free drinks, and good times! Imagine these are \"Roles\" assigned to people at a concert. This is authorization who is allowed to do what. Typically in applications we have users for basic use, admin for high influence use, and a few other various roles for various levels of access. Although restrictions should apply to everyone, there is always someone trying to get in for free or trying to bypass the security. When we build apps with data that needs to be allowed to certain person-users but restricted to others, we need to implement Authorization . This is the process of assigning roles to each person-user. Maybe you're building a classroom management app for you and your students. All of the data for this app will be stored in the same database and served by the same server but you don't want your students to have access to other students' grades and turned-in assignments but still have access to their own assignments and grades. However, for you, as the teacher you want to be able to see all of the student's grades. To solve this problem you would assign each user of the app a role when they sign-up so each has specific levels of authorization. Teachers would get a teacher role, students would get a student role and maybe parents would get a parent role so they could see their child's grades but not submit assignments for them. In your Firebase project, you will be writing rules that that asks if they are a teacher to access the resources behind the getAllGrades() so that student and parent users would be blocked from this particular resource. This will allow them access using if statements asking if the current signed in user has a certain role. For example, if a teacher/user is signed in, and that teacher is trying to access all data pertaining to grades for their students, that teacher/user must have the role teacher in order to access any documents about the students grades. This will prevent the roles student and parent from seeing these particular documents, unless those particular grades refer back to the student in requesting it. We can also set rules based on a user's id . This will allow us to connect certain documents with the current user that is signed in. So if a user /student is logged in, they should only have access to their grades and will be restricted from trying to see any other type of document stored in our database.","title":"Authentication vs Authorization"},{"location":"module-2/authentication/#the-steps-of-authentication","text":"Authentication is the process of comparing passwords to passwords to verify or authenticate the identity of a user.

When one signs-up on any web app, their credentials (username/email & password) will be sent from the front-end to the server and written to the database. NOTE: It's important to understand this because it will help you visualize how the server will be checking incoming \"sign-in\" credentials against previously written \"sign-up\" credentials. Input and submit email/username & password info on front-end to \"sign-up\" Front-End sends POST request with the the email/username & password to the server The server receives the credentials and INSERTs a new entry in the users table The user returns to the app to login by inputting and submitting their email & password on the front-end The front-end sends a POST Request with the credentials to the server The server SELECTS the previously written email that matches and checks to see if the passwords match If true the next page in the app is sent to the front-end and a bearer token is stored in cookies (more on this soon) If false another \"login\" page is sent to the front-end","title":"The Sign-Up Overview"},{"location":"module-2/authentication/#hashing","text":"There's a small step in Step 3 & 6 of the summary above that was excluded called hashing . See, when we store passwords in our database we don't want to store plaintext because if our database is ever breached(hacked) the passwords will be readable by human-eyes and simple JavaScript functions. To protect our users we create new strings that represent the passwords called a hash . A hash is a unique and complicated string created by passing a simple string into a mathematical formula (algorithm) that scrambles and generates a unique string. The way it works is highly mathematical (luckily there are Node packages for it) but in short it could look like this: MD5 Password Hashing Algorithm Simple String The Hashed String pony 4B3E3C2F99046F92A61BAB6775848577 apple 1F3870BE274F6C49B3E31A0C6728957F pony 4B3E3C2F99046F92A61BAB6775848577 No matter what, if you pass pony through this specific hashing algorithm (MD5) is will also produce the 4B3E3C2F99046F92A61BAB6775848577 every time. This is how passwords can be stored as hashes and later compared, hash to hash. We just use a hashing algorithm in the route on our server between receiving the request to \"login\" and when the server reads the previously stored hash in the database created during \"sign-up\". You can play with how the MD5 hashing algorithm will create unique strings with any common string you put in here. Once the plaintext password has been hashed the new unique String will be stored in the database along with the username/email.","title":"Hashing"},{"location":"module-2/authentication/#the-code-for-hashing","text":"Below is a small Express server that has a hashing algorithm added to it called argon2 .

If it does, the server will run the hashing function crypto.randonBytes & argon2i .hash on the password. You are probably wondering what salt is. Salt is the number of times the algorithm is supposed to run before the hash is determined \"complete\". Hackers have access to run the same algorithm that creates your password hashes. This means, if they get ahold of your list of usernames & passwords they can run them backwards as well and learn the plaintext version of your passwords and then access your user's data. Nevertheless, they will still be guessing at possible inputs to get to the correct password. To break through this barrier they will formulate something called a Brute Force attack , where in, they tell a powerful computer to run the same algorithm over and over on the list of hashed passwords attempting to get the right passwords. This is where a salt round comes in. A salt round is the number of times the algorithm scrambles the plaintext password. 1 salt = 1 time, 5 salts = 5 times. Each time you increase the salt you increase the difficulty for the hacker by a factor of about 10! By increasing this number you make it more expensive in both time and energy for the hacker to make it profitable to hack your users. The double-edge of this sword is that it also makes it more expensive for your computers to run the hashing algorithm. The trick is to find a happy medium! Usually 12 is the ideal number; but, some have suggested you calculate the number with the total amount of time you can stand . To get an idea of why salting is so important when hashing password, check out this post from 2011. Luckily, you won't have to be dealing with Express Servers, Argon 2, Hashing or Salting because you'll be using Firebase!","title":"The Code for Hashing"},{"location":"module-2/authentication/#the-sign-in-overview","text":"Now that we know passwords will be hashed on sign-up , what happens when a user signs-in?

Instead, we want them to have them sign-in once and then allow them to freely move around their account until they sign-off. The trouble is that our server (just a computer) doesn't know who they are like we humans would if we saw them. So, to make this work we have to give the user a \"wristband\" that they would show to each part of the server when they wanted to see a new page or resource. This \"wristband\" is called a bearer token . A bearer token , or a JSON Web Token (JWT) , is a unique set of letters and numbers created by the server the represents a successful sign-in. It's generated when username & passwords match and sent back to the client (the user) as proof of the matching username and password. It's then stored on their device so that it can be sent back to the server with each new subsequent request to see a new page or resource. In this way, the user can move freely about their account without worrying about signing-in over and over; but instead we developers just have to be smart enough to make that front-end client send the bearer token back with each new request, and make our server require a bearer token to allow the resources to be sent back with the response.","title":"The Sign-In Overview"},{"location":"module-2/authentication/#creating-a-jwt","text":"A JWT might look like this: 1 eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c Look closely and you'll see two \".\" periods between these random strings of letters and numbers.

It will be a music app with a few simple operations. During this process we will make use of state , props , lifecycle methods , forms and styling with Material UI to create a login screen and dashboard that interacts with user controls. You will have both class days this week to complete the project and upload your GitHub URL to the assignment submission. Keep in mind that with this project, the goal is to use our existing knowledge of React to build something that looks very similar to the example images below. Unlike some homework assignments where the exact steps are laid out, this project is intentionally vague in some places. It's to get you to learn how to look up things and implement the right resources. That being said, hints will be given in various sections. Do your best and have fun! Example One Example Two Project Instructions Setup We will be working from scratch so you will need to create your own GitHub repository for this project and call it JS411-my-music-app . Do that now. Project Work 1. Initializing Navigate to a directory of your choosing (wherever you want your project to be) and run the command npx create-react-app my-music-app . A new folder called my-music-app should have been created. Once your project( my-music-app ) is created (with npx create-react-app using your terminal) you can navigate to that directory and run the commands git init and git remote add origin <YOUR_GIT_REPOSITORY_URL> to connect your local application to your remote repository. Now run npm start to see the default create-react-app code running. Additionally, install Material UI in this folder: npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled . 2. Login Screen Next, you will want to get rid of the default contents inside of App.js of create-react-app and replace them with the login screen. From the examples, the first thing you are probably noticing is the navigation bar. HINT: You can find the App Bar Component on the Material UI page. There are examples for integrating it. You will also want the Button and TextField components from Material UI. Search the site to find examples of those. If you want to add additional styling to these components, simply add the CSS to the App.css file for now. You can add a className on Material UI components just like you can with any other component. HINT: Add a property called loggedIn to your state that has a Boolean value. It should be set to false as the default. When you click the button to login, set that variable to true . You will probably want to do some conditional rendering here to show the login screen if the user is not logged in or show something else otherwise. As a refresher...conditional rendering with a ternary operator looks like this: a Ternary Example 1 2 3 4 5 render () { return this . state . loggedIn ? < Dashboard /> : ( // the code for your login screen ) } a Regular If/Else Example 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 render () { if ( this . state . loggedIn ) { return < Dashboard /> } else { return ( // the code for your login screen ) } } As a final note for the login session, you can make both the username and password fields required but don't worry about any other validation here. You can put whatever you want in those fields, click 'login' and it will work. We can learn more about true authentication in later weeks. 3. Components Folder Make a folder called components/ inside your src/ folder to hold any other components you wish to make in the future. You will need at least one more for the dashboard page. 4. Dashboard Component Make a component called Dashboard.js inside the components/ folder. You will want to create this component and then import it back into App.js to be conditionally rendered based on login like in the examples above. For now feel free to render something simple in this component like <p>testing</p> to see if it's working. HINT: If you noticed that you lost the nav bar when you navigated to this component then it makes sense because it was probably hardcoded in the App.js file. Find a way to break it out into its own component (maybe NavBar.js) and wrap App component with it so that it always shows up. Inside Dashboard.js you will want to create three cards; the Card component, as well as, its accompanying CardContent and CardActions can be found by looking in Material UI docs . HINT: You might choose to use flexbox (or grid ) to evenly space these three cards across the dashboard. 5. Card 1 - Online Mode This card will need access to the Switch Component . Think about setting a variable in state called online and having it be a Boolean value to represent the online status. When the switch is clicked, make sure the state gets updated: false to true . 6. Card 2 - Master Volume This card will need access to the Slider Component . Think about setting a variable in state called volume and having it be a number like 20 . When the slider is changed, update the state with the correct volume. HINT: Set your volume on a scale of 0 to 100 with steps of 10 at a time. 7. Card 3 - Sound Quality This card will need access to the Select Component . Think about setting a variable in state called \"quality\" and having it be a number of 1, 2 or 3, representing \"Low\", \"Normal\" or \"High\" quality. When the select box is changed make sure the state gets updated. 8. System Notifications Create a state variable in the Dashboard component called notifications and make it an empty array. When any other piece of state changes ( online , volume , quality ) update the notifications array with the corresponding messages. Here are the rules to follow: If the online status is \"false\" add the message Your application is offline. You won't be able to share or stream music to other devices. If the volume exceeds 80, add the message Listening to music at a high volume could cause long-term hearing loss. If the sound quality is changed to low, add the message Music quality is degraded. Increase quality if your connection allows it. HINT: Consider using the componentDidUpdate lifecycle method so that you know whenever the component state has changed. You can access the previous state with the prevState variable. More information on this: React componentDidUpdate() . Make sure to map through these notifications and display them underneath a \"System Notifications\" heading. Remember: you also have next class to work on this. Start reading the next pre-homework to understand more about lifecycle methods.

If you want to add additional styling to these components, simply add the CSS to the App.css file for now. You can add a className on Material UI components just like you can with any other component. HINT: Add a property called loggedIn to your state that has a Boolean value. It should be set to false as the default. When you click the button to login, set that variable to true . You will probably want to do some conditional rendering here to show the login screen if the user is not logged in or show something else otherwise. As a refresher...conditional rendering with a ternary operator looks like this: a Ternary Example 1 2 3 4 5 render () { return this . state . loggedIn ? < Dashboard /> : ( // the code for your login screen ) } a Regular If/Else Example 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 render () { if ( this . state . loggedIn ) { return < Dashboard /> } else { return ( // the code for your login screen ) } } As a final note for the login session, you can make both the username and password fields required but don't worry about any other validation here.

Today we will take a deeper dive into React's Class-Based Component Lifecycle and the methods involved, but before we do let's look at this JSX syntax a little more closely. Overview The Component Lifecycle is a set of steps that every class-based component goes through from when the component is referenced/invoked and mounted in the DOM to when it is closed out and removed from the DOM, birth to death. This Lifecycle can be divided into 4 phases: Mounting , Updating , Unmounting , & Error . Inside of each of these phases are individual methods(properties with functions as their definition/value). These methods are appropriately classified as lifecycle methods because they get called throughout each phase and each has a purpose... we will get into soon. Why? The purpose of these lifecycle methods is to capture or encapsulate the manipulation, moving, and rendering of data inside of each component, just like JSX provides easier syntax for doing this. Having the ability to pinpoint certain points of execution during a component's \"life\" gives us greater flexibility, programming customization, and testing opportunities. For example, we may want to load some data into our component before we render it onto the screen. It just so happens that there is a lifecycle method called componentDidMount that fires after the initial render method. This is a great place to make a call for that data. And yes, render() is a lifecycle method too. If your data hasn't come back from the API yet you might offer the user a spinning wheel or cute animation through the use of conditional rendering in your render statement so when your data does come in, you can call render again. These methods become more and more useful as you grow into your new trade and become more proficient. For now, let's cover the most commonly used methods and how to mentally model what they are and how to use them. Read It - Class-Based Component Lifecycle We've talked briefly about what the component lifecycle is and why it's useful so let's get a little more into the details of the operation. I'd like to start with how these lifecycle methods are accessed. From the past couple classes, you've likely become familiar with seeing a component written like this: Two ways to extend Component 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 import React from 'react' class MyComponent extends React . Component { render () { return ( < div > < h1 > Welcome to our component < /p> < /div> ) } } // Or... import React , { Component } from 'react' class MyComponent extends Component { render () { return ( < div > < h1 > Welcome to our component < /p> < /div> ) } } The above two examples are the exact same in terms of functionality. The only difference is that we imported Component separately in the second example. Let's talk about that a little. The reason we have access to any of these methods (for example: render ) is because of the \"Component\" keyword on line 1 and/or 3 of the two examples above. When we create our component with class MyComponent ... and use extends Component , which we've imported from React , we are saying (in code) that we want our class to have all the capabilities of a React class component (a class that is built into the React node module). The method render actually lives on that Component and the only reason we get to use it is that we \"extended\" from Component with a class of our own. Fortunately for us, Component has a few other useful methods to use the same way: The componentDidMount Method This method, when used in your component, fires when the component is inserted into the DOM tree. This happens after the initial \"render\" method and can be useful for fetching data or updating state based on some conditions. The componentDidMount method (and other lifecycle methods) are usually placed above the render method. Here's an example: Example of componentDidMount 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 import React , { Component } from 'react' class MyComponent extends Component { componentDidMount () { fetch ( 'http://example.com' ) . then ( res => res . json ()) . then ( examples => { this . setState ({ data : examples }) }) } render () { return ( < div > < h1 > Welcome to our component < /p> < p > Take a look at our data : { this . state . data } < /p> < /div> ) } } The render Method This may seem redundant but the render method is important to understand since it is the only required method when using a class component. The render method typically returns JSX but it can also return other things, namely: Arrays Strings/Numbers Booleans Null The above options aren't typical so we will focus on JSX. It's also important to note that the render method should be a \"pure function\" which means it doesn't update state . The second rule to render is that it must return something ...JSX, null , an array, whatever. It must return something. Speaking of state, we need to remember that this render method will be invoked each time the state changes. Calling this.setState() anywhere in your component will cause this function to fire again and update the parts of the DOM that may have changed. In the following code, how many times will the render method be called on initiation? Simple Class Component 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 import React , { Component } from 'react' class MyComponent extends Component { constructor () { this . state = { users : [] } } componentDidMount () { const arr = this . props . users . filter ( u => u . username . length > 5 ) this . setState ({ users : arr }) } handleClick = () => { this . setState ({ users : [... this . state . users ]. concat ([ 'newUser' ]) }) } render () { return ( < div > < h1 > Welcome to our component < /p> < p > Here ' s an array with our users : { this . state . users } < /p> < button onClick = { this . handleClick } > Add User < /button> < /div> ) } } The key is in the word \"initially\" . Hopefully you guessed 2 times. The render will be invoked a third time when the button is clicked. The answer is two because this.setState is asynchronous and the initial render will attempt before the componentDidMount function is complete. However, componentDidMount will quickly update the state and re-render the component without the user noticing anything. You can read more about that process in the React Docs . Before we move to another lifecycle method let's remember that everything is an object including this React component we're extending. What this means is that it too has properties, or methods(because their values are functions). Just like all of the methods on the DOM or any HTML element you've worked with like onclick, hover, blur...etc, this React Component has method that are firing blanks throughout the cycles of its life until YOU, the developer, give them instructions. Here's invalid code but a good visual example of what the Component you're extending looks like under-the-hood. Under-the-hood look at the lifecycle methods - Invalid Code! 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 // * React Class Component /Object-Thing/ myComponent = { constructor : () => { /* create state here */ }, componentDidMount : () => { /* fetch data here */ }, componentDidUpdate : () => {}, componentWillUnmount : () => { /* delete cookies, unsubscribe from current connections, sign out here */ }, render : () => { /* return the visual for the DOM in JSX here */ }, componentDidCatch : () => { /* process error handling here */ }, getDerivedStateFromError : () => {}, shouldComponentUpdate : () => {}, getSnapshotBeforeUpdate : () => {}, getDerivedStateFromProps : () => {}, } Now that you see each property is already declared on the class, you can now go and define them with whatever your application's needs are! If you don't need them, don't worry about them they'll just fire blanks with no side-effects! The componentDidUpdate Method This method is called when the component is updated. What does \"updated\" mean? It means when this.setState is called somewhere in the tree that affects the current component. This lifecycle method is not called on the initial load of the component. When it is called it automatically gives us a variable called prevProps that we can use to see if any of the props changed. You can call this.setState in this function but you want to be careful to do it based on some condition. If you don't, you'll cause an infinite loop because setState will cause the component to \"update\" which will then call setState which will cause it to update again, etc, etc, etc. For this reason, this is Example of componentDidUpdate 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 componentDidUpdate ( prevProps , prevState , snapshot ) { // will not be invoked if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false. // Use to do side effects if the state or props change and those create a need for a side-effect like a data fetch/network request or visuals // fired every time render is called after the initial render call // If we have a snapshot value, we've just added new items. // Adjust scroll so these new items don't push the old ones out of view. // (snapshot here is the value returned from getSnapshotBeforeUpdate) if ( snapshot !== null ) { const list = this . listRef . current ; list . scrollTop = list . scrollHeight - snapshot ; } } Usage example of componentDidUpdate 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 // this.setState({}) -> // componentDidUpdate() -> // this.setState({})-> // componentDidUpdate() -> // this.setState({})-> // etc. // This lifecycle method can be used like this: import React , { Component } from 'react' class MyComponent extends Component { constructor () { this . state = { users : [], errText : \"\" } } componentDidUpdate () { if ( this . state . users . length === 0 ) { this . setState ({ errText : 'There are no users to show' }) } } handleClick = () => { // This line is a shorthand to set the state to equal what the list of users was plus the new user that was added. this . setState ({ users : [... this . state . users ]. concat ([ 'newUser' ]) }) } render () { return ( < div > < h1 > Welcome to our component < /h1> { this . state . errText && < p > { this . state . errText } < /p>} < p > Here ' s an array with our users : { this . state . users } < /p> < button onClick = { this . handleClick } > Add User < /button> < /div> ) } } The constructor Method The constructor is the first thing that happens when you load up a component. In fact, it's the first thing that happens anytime you use a class in JavaScript for any purpose (not just React). Inside the constructor is where you initialize variables that your class, or component, will use. For example, this is where you typically set your initial state. You also call the super() function inside of the constructor. This function calls the parent constructor with the data you've passed in, but we don't need to know about the details of that here so let's take a look at how we use the constructor: Example Usage of constructor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 import React , { Component } from 'react' class MyComponent extends Component { constructor () { super () // calls the functionality of the grandparent class(the class parent of the Component class) this . state = { count : 0 } } handleClick = () => { this . setState ({ count : this . state . count + 1 }) } render () { return ( < div > < p > The count is : { this . state . count } < /p> < button onClick = { this . handleClick } > Add 1 < /button> < /div> ) } } It's important to note that many people have stopped using the constructor in such verbose terms since React released shortcuts for writing this. Essentially, it does the same thing behind the scenes but the above can now also be written as: State without calling constructor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 import React , { Component } from 'react' class MyComponent extends Component { state = { count : 0 } handleClick = () => { this . setState ({ count : this . state . count + 1 }) } render () { return ( < div > < p > The count is : { this . state . count } < /p> < button onClick = { this . handleClick } > Add 1 < /button> < /div> ) } } Order of Operations The lifecycle methods we just covered were not in any specific order so below we'll order them by the way they fire when the component is mounted , rendered , updated , unmounted , and if an error occurs. These phases are the phases of the components cycle of life, a.k.a the order in which the methods are fired as the component comes into the DOM(mounts) and eventually leaves the DOM (unmounts). Mounting Phase constructor() render() Updating Phase shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) render() componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot) getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) Unmounting Phase componentWillUnmount() - used to fire before the render method but it is now considered legacy and unsafe to use. Error Phase - Not used to handle exceptions! componentDidCatch() getDerivedStateFromError() A full, comprehensive breakdown of all lifecycle methods can be found in here . We encourage you to look at this page often as well as use this lifecycle cheatsheet as you develop.

Today we will take a deeper dive into React's Class-Based Component Lifecycle and the methods involved, but before we do let's look at this JSX syntax a little more closely.","title":"Component Lifecycle"},{"location":"module-2/componentLifeCycle/#overview","text":"The Component Lifecycle is a set of steps that every class-based component goes through from when the component is referenced/invoked and mounted in the DOM to when it is closed out and removed from the DOM, birth to death. This Lifecycle can be divided into 4 phases: Mounting , Updating , Unmounting , & Error . Inside of each of these phases are individual methods(properties with functions as their definition/value). These methods are appropriately classified as lifecycle methods because they get called throughout each phase and each has a purpose... we will get into soon.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"module-2/componentLifeCycle/#why","text":"The purpose of these lifecycle methods is to capture or encapsulate the manipulation, moving, and rendering of data inside of each component, just like JSX provides easier syntax for doing this. Having the ability to pinpoint certain points of execution during a component's \"life\" gives us greater flexibility, programming customization, and testing opportunities. For example, we may want to load some data into our component before we render it onto the screen. It just so happens that there is a lifecycle method called componentDidMount that fires after the initial render method. This is a great place to make a call for that data. And yes, render() is a lifecycle method too. If your data hasn't come back from the API yet you might offer the user a spinning wheel or cute animation through the use of conditional rendering in your render statement so when your data does come in, you can call render again. These methods become more and more useful as you grow into your new trade and become more proficient. For now, let's cover the most commonly used methods and how to mentally model what they are and how to use them.","title":"Why?"},{"location":"module-2/componentLifeCycle/#read-it-class-based-component-lifecycle","text":"We've talked briefly about what the component lifecycle is and why it's useful so let's get a little more into the details of the operation. I'd like to start with how these lifecycle methods are accessed. From the past couple classes, you've likely become familiar with seeing a component written like this: Two ways to extend Component 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 import React from 'react' class MyComponent extends React . Component { render () { return ( < div > < h1 > Welcome to our component < /p> < /div> ) } } // Or... import React , { Component } from 'react' class MyComponent extends Component { render () { return ( < div > < h1 > Welcome to our component < /p> < /div> ) } } The above two examples are the exact same in terms of functionality. The only difference is that we imported Component separately in the second example. Let's talk about that a little. The reason we have access to any of these methods (for example: render ) is because of the \"Component\" keyword on line 1 and/or 3 of the two examples above. When we create our component with class MyComponent ... and use extends Component , which we've imported from React , we are saying (in code) that we want our class to have all the capabilities of a React class component (a class that is built into the React node module). The method render actually lives on that Component and the only reason we get to use it is that we \"extended\" from Component with a class of our own. Fortunately for us, Component has a few other useful methods to use the same way:","title":"Read It - Class-Based Component Lifecycle"},{"location":"module-2/componentLifeCycle/#the-componentdidmount-method","text":"This method, when used in your component, fires when the component is inserted into the DOM tree. This happens after the initial \"render\" method and can be useful for fetching data or updating state based on some conditions. The componentDidMount method (and other lifecycle methods) are usually placed above the render method. Here's an example: Example of componentDidMount 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 import React , { Component } from 'react' class MyComponent extends Component { componentDidMount () { fetch ( 'http://example.com' ) . then ( res => res . json ()) . then ( examples => { this . setState ({ data : examples }) }) } render () { return ( < div > < h1 > Welcome to our component < /p> < p > Take a look at our data : { this . state . data } < /p> < /div> ) } }","title":"The componentDidMount Method"},{"location":"module-2/componentLifeCycle/#the-render-method","text":"This may seem redundant but the render method is important to understand since it is the only required method when using a class component. The render method typically returns JSX but it can also return other things, namely: Arrays Strings/Numbers Booleans Null The above options aren't typical so we will focus on JSX. It's also important to note that the render method should be a \"pure function\" which means it doesn't update state . The second rule to render is that it must return something ...JSX, null , an array, whatever. It must return something. Speaking of state, we need to remember that this render method will be invoked each time the state changes. Calling this.setState() anywhere in your component will cause this function to fire again and update the parts of the DOM that may have changed. In the following code, how many times will the render method be called on initiation? Simple Class Component 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 import React , { Component } from 'react' class MyComponent extends Component { constructor () { this . state = { users : [] } } componentDidMount () { const arr = this . props . users . filter ( u => u . username . length > 5 ) this . setState ({ users : arr }) } handleClick = () => { this . setState ({ users : [... this . state . users ]. concat ([ 'newUser' ]) }) } render () { return ( < div > < h1 > Welcome to our component < /p> < p > Here ' s an array with our users : { this . state . users } < /p> < button onClick = { this . handleClick } > Add User < /button> < /div> ) } } The key is in the word \"initially\" . Hopefully you guessed 2 times. The render will be invoked a third time when the button is clicked. The answer is two because this.setState is asynchronous and the initial render will attempt before the componentDidMount function is complete. However, componentDidMount will quickly update the state and re-render the component without the user noticing anything. You can read more about that process in the React Docs . Before we move to another lifecycle method let's remember that everything is an object including this React component we're extending. What this means is that it too has properties, or methods(because their values are functions). Just like all of the methods on the DOM or any HTML element you've worked with like onclick, hover, blur...etc, this React Component has method that are firing blanks throughout the cycles of its life until YOU, the developer, give them instructions. Here's invalid code but a good visual example of what the Component you're extending looks like under-the-hood. Under-the-hood look at the lifecycle methods - Invalid Code! 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 // * React Class Component /Object-Thing/ myComponent = { constructor : () => { /* create state here */ }, componentDidMount : () => { /* fetch data here */ }, componentDidUpdate : () => {}, componentWillUnmount : () => { /* delete cookies, unsubscribe from current connections, sign out here */ }, render : () => { /* return the visual for the DOM in JSX here */ }, componentDidCatch : () => { /* process error handling here */ }, getDerivedStateFromError : () => {}, shouldComponentUpdate : () => {}, getSnapshotBeforeUpdate : () => {}, getDerivedStateFromProps : () => {}, } Now that you see each property is already declared on the class, you can now go and define them with whatever your application's needs are! If you don't need them, don't worry about them they'll just fire blanks with no side-effects!","title":"The render Method"},{"location":"module-2/componentLifeCycle/#the-componentdidupdate-method","text":"This method is called when the component is updated. What does \"updated\" mean? It means when this.setState is called somewhere in the tree that affects the current component. This lifecycle method is not called on the initial load of the component.

You can call this.setState in this function but you want to be careful to do it based on some condition.

That is the basic logic for creating applications but what about how they look? You should be familiar with CSS through 101 but today we are going to introduce a new styling tool... Material UI. Overview There are many different ways to style applications in React . You can use: CSS files that you've created and import them Third-party CSS (ex. Bootstrap), again import them and use their pre-built micro-components Styled components from various open source providers with libraries like Material UI The reason we are introducing Material UI is because it is a robust, cross-platform component library backed by Google. It was written by two former Google UI engineers and designed by one of Google's design teams . Before you move on, watch the backstory to a major project called Material Design by Google which gave birth to Material UI . NOTE: In this video at 2:43 use this command to install: npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled More on Material-UI We mentioned the words \"component library\". But what does that mean? Well...a component library is a set of pre-built components that satisfy some specific design requirement. For example...say I want all the buttons on my website to look the same (or similar). This is something that you usually want for consistency and good design. Well, Material UI provides a pre-built Button component that you can import into your code like this: import { Button } from '@mui/material'; These buttons come with pre-determined styles but can be further styled to your liking. See the code snippet and example screenshot below: the JSX 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 < Button variant = \"contained\" color = \"primary\" className = { classes . button } > Primary < /Button> < Button variant = \"contained\" color = \"secondary\" className = { classes . button } > Secondary < /Button> < Button variant = \"contained\" color = \"secondary\" disabled className = { classes . button } > Disabled < /Button> the Result You've probably noticed the import statement above somewhere else and up until this point may have been wondering what Material UI is in the technical sense or how to use it. If so, I've got great news: it's simply an NPM package that we need to install. We do so by running this command: npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled . Material UI uses the peer dependency emotion as a styling engine. More information can be found on this NPM package at NPMjs.com . Additionally, the documentation on all available components is available at the Material UI documentation. Be sure to use the navigation to look under the components folder. There is a lot of information available. So that's enough about what Material-UI is. Let's see it in action: the JS 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 import React from 'react' ; import { Button } from '@mui/material' const App = () => { return ( < div style = {{ padding : '50px' }} > < h2 > Here ' s an example of a button using Material UI :< /h2> < Button variant = \"contained\" > Click Me < /Button> < /div> ) } export default App ; the Result In the above component, we simply import ed the Button from @mui/material and then used it below our heading. We supplied the prop, variant with a value of \"contained\" to tell the button that we want the border around it. Normally it comes without it. You can look more into the options, examples & why \"contained\" creates a border in the Button docs . So what does that code equate to when we run it? Take a look at \"the Result\" tab above. In Summary In conclusion, if you want to create a cool-looking, uniform experience across your application...use Material UI. See if they have a component for your needs. Buttons , Checkboxes , Radio Buttons , Selects , Sliders , Text Fields and more are all available for use. We will use Material UI to style our App in this week's lesson so go get familiar with the Docs . See It - Using Material-UI NOTE: In this video at 4:49 you will see makeStyles but the preferred design pattern is higher order component: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 const ExpandMore = styled (( props ) => { const { expand , ... other } = props ; return < IconButton {... other } /> ; })(({ theme , expand }) => ({ transform : ! expand ? 'rotate(0deg)' : 'rotate(180deg)' , marginLeft : 'auto' , transition : theme . transitions . create ( 'transform' , { duration : theme . transitions . duration . shortest , }), })); NOTE-2: If you want to use makeStyles you will need to make sure it is in a themeProvider component see: V4 to v5 migration : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 // ...imports function AppContent ( props ) { const classes = useStyles (); // \u2705 This is safe because it is called... // ...inside ThemeProvider return < Card className = { classes . root } > ... < /Card>; } function App ( props ) { return ( < ThemeProvider theme = { theme } > < CssBaseline /> < AppContent {... props } /> < /ThemeProvider> ); } export default App ; Practice It Navigate to the following URL: https://codesandbox.io/s/new?from-embed . Under the \"Dependencies\" heading on the left side of the screen, click blue button that says \"Add Dependency\" Search for \"@mui/material\" exactly as written. It will be the top one. Click it to install it. Search for \"@emotion/styled\" exactly as written. It will be the top one. Click it to install it. Search for \"@emotion/react\" exactly as written. It will be the top one. Click it to install it. Now on line 3 of the code editor type import { Button } from '@mui/material' and press Enter . After line 11 (the h2 ), add the following: <Button>Click Me</Button> . You should see a button appear. Now on line 3 put a comma after the word Button and type TextField to import the TextField component. Above the button insert the following: <TextField label=\"Enter some text\" /> and below that line add <br /> for now just to give some separation. Do you see the text field? Try typing in it just to get a sense of its style. You're done! Easy styles and components for React with Material-UI.

Let's see it in action: the JS 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 import React from 'react' ; import { Button } from '@mui/material' const App = () => { return ( < div style = {{ padding : '50px' }} > < h2 > Here ' s an example of a button using Material UI :< /h2> < Button variant = \"contained\" > Click Me < /Button> < /div> ) } export default App ; the Result In the above component, we simply import ed the Button from @mui/material and then used it below our heading. We supplied the prop, variant with a value of \"contained\" to tell the button that we want the border around it. Normally it comes without it. You can look more into the options, examples & why \"contained\" creates a border in the Button docs . So what does that code equate to when we run it? Take a look at \"the Result\" tab above.","title":"More on Material-UI"},{"location":"module-2/componentStyling/#in-summary","text":"In conclusion, if you want to create a cool-looking, uniform experience across your application...use Material UI.

Test your App to see if it works! NOTE: This video was recorded before reactRouter v6. NOTE-2: We don't use <Switch> anymore. It is now <Routes> . NOTE-3: And now, you will import Routes and Route from react-router-dom . NOTE-4: Also, instead of using the component={ComponentName} prop you'll use the element={<ComponentName} prop. Your example should look more like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 import React from 'react' ; import { Routes , Route } from 'react-router-dom' ; import App from './App' ; import Home from './Home' ; const Router = () => { return ( { /* Then we use Routes and Route. Routes acts like a regular JS Switch Statement */ } < Routes > { /* depending on the path in the URL, one of these Routes will be returned and their component rendered */ } < Route path = \"/home\" element = { < Home /> } /> < Route path = \"/app\" element = { < App /> } /> < /Routes> ); } export default Router ; Implementing Link Implementing Link Video Video Outline 1. Go to the simple components: <HelloWorldOne /> & <HelloWorldTwo /> 2. import { Link } from 'react-router-dom' 3. Add your wherever you want!!! 4. <Link to=\"/yourpath\"> 5. Remove underline... style={{ textDecoration: \"none\" }} 6. Use a Material-UI Button... import Button from \"@mui/material/Button\"; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 < Link to = \"/home\" > < Button style = {{ margin : \"5% auto\" }} variant = \"outlined\" color = \"primary\" > Go BackHome < /Button> < /Link> 7. Create two more components called: <SignIn /> & <SignUp /> and give them all Links to go to <HelloWorldOne /> & <HelloWorldTwo /> & <SignIn /> & <SignUp /> 8. Bonus 1: Use a Material-UI Button Group to do it!!! 9. Bonus 2: Create a new component for the Button Group and import it into the other four components: <HelloWorldOne /> & <HelloWorldTwo /> & <SignIn /> & <SignUp /> or whichever components you've decided to use. Another Method to Implement Link with MUI Button MUI will also accept another property named component which can take the value of any component we want to render in it's place. By doing this, we will not need to overwrite Link 's default styling since MUI will overwrite it using this method. You can now also add the to property, which we can specify the route we want to navigate to, to our Button , and now our Link will have access to that to property as well. Here is an example on how to implement Link and MUI's Button: 1 2 3 4 5 // Of course, don't forget your necessary imports... < Button component = { Link } to = \"/login\" variant = \"outlined\" color = \"primary\" > Login < /Button> You can refer to MUI's Button API to see a list of different properties the Button component may take. Practice It Practice Section Instructions Open the code editor and navigate to App.js on the left-hand side The dependencies have already been imported for you.

You've covered so much but there is a small piece we need to solve for you to fully build a web app and that's authentication. Authentication, as you've just learned, is the process of verifying the identify of a user via multiple methods including email/password, google/facebook account, phone number or individual links. This process all happens on the back-end and can get complicated (not that you can't build your own...but you're only learning front-end programming here right now). Enter Firebase. Firebase will act as our database and server while providing authentication, authorization and user management. It's a simple, easy, and free tool you can capitalize on to build incredible apps with. Why firebase Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) a Google cloud service for developers to utilize all behind-the-scenes aspects of a web or mobile application so that they only have to write and maintain the frontend. Increasingly, more of software engineering complexity is moving from the back end to the frontend. Firebase allows all in one back end solution for Android, iOS, and the web so that all 3 can share 1 backend. Moreover, Firebase has a generous free/demo tier no charge if less than 1 gigabyte in storage. BaaS solutions are very attractive for companies. there are many BaaS services and FireBase is one of the most widely used service. Here's a list of companies that use Firebase. How to use FireBase The following is a follow-along where you'll build an app with Firebase. This will set you up for the next class and prepare you for building your Capstone App,. Create a Front-End with React The first step is to create a new React app in your devFolder : npx create-react-app learn-firebase Install firebase your new React app: cd learn-firebase npm i firebase Create a Back-End with Firebase Step-by-Step Setting up a Firebase Back-End App 1. Start by signing up for an account on Firebase . > You may have to create a Google account if you do not have one. Remember, the service is free for up to 1 gigabyte of storage. 2. Once you've signed in with your Google account click the \"Get Started\" button on the main firebase page. 3. Click the \"Create a Project\" button and name it learn-firebase then click \"Continue\". 4. We will not use Google analytics for this project but it's okay to leave it as the default setting. 5. From the drop down select your \"Default Account\" for Firebase and press \"Create Project\". 6. Click \"Continue\" after the project is initialized 7. On the main Firebase Console page, find the Gear Icon in the top-left click it and select \"Project Settings\" 8. Under \"Your Apps\" at the bottom of the page, you will see no projects and several icons click the one for Web `` 9. Under \"Register app\" give your app a nickname like firstFirebase App then click \"Register app\" 10. If you didn't earlier, run the npm install firebase command to install the Firebase package into your React app. 11. Then create a config file called firebaseConfig.js - run touch src/firebaseConfig.js . 12. Now copy/paste all the code you see on the screen into this new firebaseConfig.js file. And Cmd + S 13. Then click \"Continue to Console\" 14. On the main console, you'll see \"Authentication\" in the navigation menu on the left. Click it. 15. And click \"Get Started\" 16. Then choose \"Email/Password\" 17. Slide the slider to \"Enable\" the click \"Save\" Screenshots of Setting up a Firebase Back-End App 2. Get Started 3. Create 3.5. Create & Name 4. Analytics 5.

Setup Authentication 15. Get Started on Auth 16. Auth Method 17. Enable + Save Hide Configuration in .env When hosting any app anywhere on the web we want to use a .env file, as a place to put sensitive environment specific data about how to build the app including database names, API_keys, users and ports, etc. With a .env , our React app will build with the sensitive information hidden to humans (except us) but still exposed wherever it's needed on the app using process.env . NOTE: A .env file is a common procedure for hiding sensitive information and exposing the information only when needed. To learn more about this check out the Additional Resources below. The final step to safeguarding our sensitive information is to include the .env file in a .gitignore file so our git software will ignore the .env file and not push it up to the repo when we commit changes, thus keeping it private from people looking at our code. NOTE: You can have git ignore any file that is unnecessary to the build of the app by including the file or folder in the .gitignore file. For good boilerplate files to ignore, checkout the Additional Resources below. Later, when we host this app live to to world we'll need to manually transfer the data in the .env to the service we use to host, likely Firebase. How to Hide To start, cd into the root directory of your app and run touch .env to create the new file. ( You're likely already in the root directory after the steps above. ) Do the same thing to create a .gitignore file - touch .gitignore Now go ahead and add .env to that file so git will ignore the .env file. Inside the .env copy/paste the data from your firebaseConfig object in the firebaseConfig.js file. Now follow the video and use the code snippets below to complete the conversion. Transfer & Convert the Sensitive Data Earlier you copy/pasted a config file from the Firebase dashboard into a firebaseConfig.js file. You're now going to move the data from the const firebaseConfig object into the .env file but change the property names and the syntax into YAML. Then, change out the values in the firebaseConfig object of the firebaseConfig.js file to read the same values but through the process.env so the values are hidden from others but exposed to the app. Check out the video for more details.

How to Authenticate with FireBase The code below is a simple sign-up and logout for the start of any app using Firebase as the back-end authentication. Replace the code in your src/App.js file with the code below and run npm start to test it out. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 // App.js import React , { useState } from 'react' ; import auth from './firebaseConfig' ; // credentials provided by firebaseConfig file from above import { createUserWithEmailAndPassword , signOut } from 'firebase/auth' // import firebase dependency function App () { const [ registeredEmail , setRegisteredEmail ] = useState ( \"\" ); const [ registeredPassword , setRegisteredPassword ] = useState ( \"\" ); const register = async () => { try { // TRY CATCH MUST BE USED ASYNC/AWAIT WHEN WORKING WITH FIREBASE const user = await createUserWithEmailAndPassword ( auth , registeredEmail , registeredPassword ); console . log ( user ); } catch ( error ) { // Give the user indication they need to try again and why // INVALID EMAIL // MISSING PASSWORD console . log ( error . message ); clearForm () } }; const logout = async () => { await signOut ( auth ); }; // clear the form inputs const clearForm = () => { document . getElementById ( \"user-form\" ). reset () } console . log ( \"auth.currentUser\" , auth . currentUser ); return ( < div > < h3 > Register User < /h3> < form id = \"user-form\" > < input placeholder = \"Email...\" onChange = {( event ) => { setRegisteredEmail ( event . target . value ); }} /> < input type = \"password\" placeholder = \"Password...\" onChange = {( event ) => { setRegisteredPassword ( event . target . value ); }} /> < button onClick = { register } > Create User < /button> < button onClick = { logout } > Sign Out < /button> < /form> < /div> ); } export default App ; The data is stored on Firebase based on the credentials in the config file. See the results in the FireBase Dashboard under \"Authentication\". In addition you will see auth.currentUser is logged at in the console of your browser.

Let's say, if we had a class grading app we would want to prevent the students from seeing the allGradesComponent while still allowing the teacher to see it. We would put this allGradesComponent behind a Protected Route that will work like an if/else statement to see if the user is allowed to view it our not. Check it out below. Overview Why are we learning about this? Well, protected routes and authentication are tools we can use to secure our app from unwanted guests. It's also a way to keep us logged in. You might have noticed last week that when we \"logged into\" our app, everything was fine but when we refreshed the page we had to \"log in\" again. That's because the app had no way of understanding that we had an active session or cookie stored. Using protected routes and authentication will allow us to leave our machine ( computer ), come back the next day and open the app and remain right where we were when we left off. Only if our cookie has expired will we be required to log in again. Let's explore these processes further. NOTE=1: This video was recorded before React v18 and the rendering method for React is now ReactDOM.createRoot() which is imported from \"react-dom/client\". NOTE: This video was recorded before react-router & react-router-dom v6. We don't use <Switch> anymore, it is now <Routes> . Also, <Redirect> has been replaced by <Navigate> . What and How First and foremost, what is a Protected Route ? Just like the routes we worked with last class, these routes are protected by some logic. Think: if (userIsAuthorized) => go to profile; else {\"Sorry, you're not authorized, please log in.\"}. It boils down to a bit of JavaScript logic that directs the user to one component or another based on some condition. It's easiest to show an example. Protected Route Example without comments 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 import { Navigate } from \"react-router-dom\" ; const ProtectedRoute = ( props ) => { const { component : Component , ... rest } = props ; return ( checkAuth () === true ? ( < Component {... rest } /> ) : ( < Navigate to = \"/login\" /> ) ); }; export default ProtectedRoute ; Protected Route Example with comments 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 // Import `Navigate` from react-router-dom import { Navigate } from \"react-router-dom\" ; // Create a component that takes props that will serve our Protected Routes const ProtectedRoute = ( props ) => { // Destructure the props passed to this component. const { component : Component , ... rest } = props ; /* The ProtectedRoute function is going to take in props as an argument. These props will contain, at the bare minimum, a component that will be rendered if the condition is met. Therefore, when we destructure the props we will say that the component to be rendered is the component being passed: `component: Component` See? We're taking the component that was passed...whatever it was and storing it in a variable called `component` (lower-case c) so we can `render()` it later by called `<Component />` Since React will expect all components to begin with a capital letter, and the 'component' property is the prop that is storing the reference to the `Component` we want to render, we simply rename `component` to 'Component` (upper-case C). Now we have a reference to what ever component was passed to this `ProtectedRoute` functions i.e. `MySettings`, `MyAccount`, etc. The `{...rest}` of the properties we spread into a variable called `rest` which uses the spread operator `...` to capture and give us a reference to any remaining properties that may have been passed to this function. We can then again reference `rest` when we need to pass those properties to another Component down the chain. */ return ( // We will create this function `checkAuth()` soon, but for now, know // it returns either `true` or `false` depending on whether someone is // logged in or not. checkAuth () === true ? ( // IF? \"checkAuth()\" returns `true`, render this Component. // See? A component protected by some logic. < Component {... rest } /> ) : ( // ELSE: `checkAuth()` must be `false` and we want to \"Navigate\" // the user to the \"/login\" route by changing their URL using the // `Navigate` component from `react-router-dom`. The `to=` property // points to the path we want to replace the URL with: `\"/login\"` < Navigate to = \"/login\" /> ) ); }; export default ProtectedRoute ; Let's talk about what this is doing: This ProtectedRoute component can accept any amount of props but the props we really want is the component property from the Route in question. On the first line... const ProtectedRoute = ({component: Component, ...rest}) => { ...we \"split\" out the Component from the rest of the props in order to use it more easily later. Next, we want to either return the Component or Navigate the user to the Login component. This will be based on a condition we will define. Think of your checkForWin() function in ticTacToe. We are referencing a custom-built checkAuth() function that we will create later. If checkAuth returns true then we will send the user on to the component they want to visit. If checkAuth returns false then we will Navigate them to the login component so that they can log in. NOTE: You don't have to remember all of this right now but know where to reference it. In the future when you are using Protected Routes (sometimes called Private Routes ) you should be able to Google something like \"React Protected Route\" for an example. Where Do We Put this Code? The ProtectedRoute component built above will be imported into our Router.js where we'll replace the element= prop of any Route we want to protect. Router.js File with ProtectedRoute Function 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 import { Routes , Router } from \"react-router-dom\" ; import Home from \"./components/Home\" ; // #1 Import the component you want to be protected import Dashboard from \"./components/Dashboard\" ; // #2 Import the ProtectedRoute import ProtectedRoute from \"./components/ProtectedRoute\" ; const Router = () => { return ( < Routes > < Route path = \"/\" element = { < Home /> } /> < Route path = \"/dashboard\" { /* #3 Replace the element prop with the ProtectedRoute and give the component you want to be rendered as ITS element prop. */ } element = { < ProtectedRoute component = { Dashboard } /> } /> < /Routes> ); }; export default Router ; NOTE: Notice how we are just sending the instance of the Dashboard component, this will be rendered by the Protected Route component based on the condition that someone is Authenticated or not. This does not need to be wrapped like a JSX element <Dashboard /> . You need to simply pass in the Dashboard reference, from our import at the top of the file, as a property into our ProtectedRoute component. Now, the <Dashboard /> component will be protected and only be shown based on some condition like is the user authenticated, after we add the checkAuth-functionality in , of course. We use the ProtectedRoute component by simply replacing the element property being rendered from one of the regular Route 's we've already built. Changing a Route to a ProtectedRoute For just a little more on this, let's look at them side by side, changing Route to a ProtectedRoute We simply change this Route to a ProtectedRoute by changing the element= property(prop). 1 2 3 4 5 // This < Route path = \"/dashboard\" element = { < Dashboard /> } /> // Becomes this < Route path = \"/dashboard\" element = { < ProtectedRoute component = { Dashboard } /> } > We pass in the ProtectedRoute component instead and make sure to include the component we just replaced with the ProtectedRoute as ITS component= prop. NOTE: The <ProtectedRoute /> element can also take any properties you want to include, but we want to make sure to include the component we do want to render IF the user is Authenticated or \"loggedIn\". See It - Protected Routes NOTE: This video was recorded before react-router & react-router-dom v6. We don't use <Switch> anymore, it is now <Routes> . Also, <Redirect> has been replaced by <Navigate> . The checkAuth() Function A very simple way to test if your protected route is working is to build a dumb function like the one below: const checkAuth = () => true The code above will say that you are always logged in and anyone will be able to navigate to your protected route. In production mode we generally want something more complicated than that. See Protected Routes with Firebase lesson . Maybe when the person enters their email and password, our server app verifies they are who they say they are then sends a token to be stored as a cookie to prove they've been authenticated. From there, our front-end app could check to see if a valid cookie exists and allows the user to the protected component/view. Let's look at how to find a cookie from the browser window , shall we? CheckAuth Function & NPM cookie 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 // With a special NPM Package called \"cookie\" import cookie from \"cookie\" ; const checkAuth = () => { const cookies = cookie . parse ( document . cookie ); return cookies [ \"loggedIn\" ] ? true : false ; }; Look closely at the function above, it's getting all of the cookies that exist on the browser and saying, \"If there's one called loggedIn , return true . Otherwise return false . cookie.parse actually comes from the NPM package called cookie . We'll be installing it shortly. (Just make sure you do the following homework.) For now, let's assume if we're looking for a cookie called: loggedIn we probably put one, or set one , there called loggedIn with our app. This means our app can now save data to the local storage of a user's computer, or more specifically, their browser's local storage! This isn't something we've done yet.....ooooh....ahhhh. Cookies Cookies are small bits of information that websites store on your browser. They are key-value pairs like objects but they only contain text. They help the browser make certain decisions using the content that's been stored in these cookies. That's exactly what we are going to do here. You can interact with cookies at anytime by typing document.cookie in the console of your browser. Go ahead and do that now... document.cookie + Enter ==> \"ASPSESSIONIDAACDSPBS=IENHHCBEBANMBEPJNLICGFGP\" (or something like that) If you did this, it should have brought back a string of characters that's hard to do anything with. This problem is solved with the cookie package from npm . It can be installed with the regular npm i cookie command. Getting a list of our available cookies is easy with cookie.parse . But first, let's talk about setting cookies. In fact, you don't even need the cookie package to do this. You simply write something like this in your browser console: document.cookie = \"loggedIn=true;Max-Age=60*1000\" + Enter The Max-Age property decides how long the cookie will live for/be valid for. This property is counted in milliseconds so if you want the cookie to last one minute, you have to use 60*1000 , (1000 milliseconds = 1 second; 1 second X 60 = 1 minute) . In React & Node world, we can use the cookie package to write simple cookies as well. It will look something like this: Setting cookies using the cookie package 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 import cookie from \"cookie\" ; // Or // const cookie = require(\"cookie\"); // Set a new cookie document . cookie = cookie . serialize ( \"loggedIn\" , \"true\" , { maxAge : 1000 * 60 }); // Delete a cookie document . cookie = cookie . serialize ( \"loggedIn\" , null , { maxAge : 0 }); // To check your new cookies console . log ( cookie . parse ( document . cookie )); The cookie.serialize() method takes in 3 parameters: the key , the value , then an Object that takes in some key/value pairs as options. The list of options when using the cookie package can be found here . Setting the maxAge attribute to 0, or a negative number, will delete the cookie from memory. So now we've set this cookie on Login which means at Logout we'll want to clear it. Keep this in mind as we move forward because we're going to continue working on the Login in portion for now. NOTE: Without the cookie package, we would need to do some extra work in order to get our cookies to be more readable and usable. By default, document.cookie will return a concatenated string with all our key/values separated by a semi-colon. This makes it hard for us to extract the right bit of information we need. The npm package, cookie , simplifies that process for us, making it more practical. Lets take a look at what it looks like to get a cookie without that cookie package. Cookies without NPM cookie - without comments 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 document . cookie = \"loggedin=true;Max-Age=1000*60\" ; document . cookie = \"anotherKey=anotherValue;Max-Age=1000*60\" ; let cookies = {}; document . cookie . split ( \";\" ). forEach (( el ) => { let keyValue = el . split ( \"=\" ); return ( cookies [ keyValue [ 0 ]] = keyValue [ 1 ]); }); Cookies without NPM cookie - with comments 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 // Set some cookies document . cookie = \"loggedin=true;Max-Age=1000*60\" ; document . cookie = \"anotherKey=anotherValue;Max-Age=1000*60\" ; // Create an object called `cookies` which will be used to store our key / values AFTER we break them down let cookies = {}; // Get cookies by calling to the cookie method on the document: // \"document.cookie\" document . cookie // \"loggedin=true;anotherKey=anotherValue // Split that concatenated string of joined key/values at the semicolons // and place it into an array . split ( \";\" ) // returns [\"loggedin=false\", \"anotherKey=anotherValue\"] // For each element in our new Array of strings . forEach (( el ) => { // Split the element AT the \"equal\" sign let keyValue = el . split ( \"=\" ); // [\"loggedin\", \"false\"] // And for every element, we return a new key/value pair and attach it // to our cookies object we create first return ( cookies [ keyValue [ 0 ]] = keyValue [ 1 ]); // At the end we get an object with 2 key values, which is much easier // to work with: // {loggedin: \"true\", anotherKey: \"anotherValue\"} }); Want to know more about cookies and what you can do with them?

In production mode we generally want something more complicated than that. See Protected Routes with Firebase lesson . Maybe when the person enters their email and password, our server app verifies they are who they say they are then sends a token to be stored as a cookie to prove they've been authenticated. From there, our front-end app could check to see if a valid cookie exists and allows the user to the protected component/view. Let's look at how to find a cookie from the browser window , shall we? CheckAuth Function & NPM cookie 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 // With a special NPM Package called \"cookie\" import cookie from \"cookie\" ; const checkAuth = () => { const cookies = cookie . parse ( document . cookie ); return cookies [ \"loggedIn\" ] ? true : false ; }; Look closely at the function above, it's getting all of the cookies that exist on the browser and saying, \"If there's one called loggedIn , return true . Otherwise return false . cookie.parse actually comes from the NPM package called cookie . We'll be installing it shortly. (Just make sure you do the following homework.) For now, let's assume if we're looking for a cookie called: loggedIn we probably put one, or set one , there called loggedIn with our app. This means our app can now save data to the local storage of a user's computer, or more specifically, their browser's local storage! This isn't something we've done yet.....ooooh....ahhhh.","title":"The checkAuth() Function"},{"location":"module-2/protectedRoutes-intro/#cookies","text":"Cookies are small bits of information that websites store on your browser. They are key-value pairs like objects but they only contain text. They help the browser make certain decisions using the content that's been stored in these cookies. That's exactly what we are going to do here. You can interact with cookies at anytime by typing document.cookie in the console of your browser. Go ahead and do that now... document.cookie + Enter ==> \"ASPSESSIONIDAACDSPBS=IENHHCBEBANMBEPJNLICGFGP\" (or something like that) If you did this, it should have brought back a string of characters that's hard to do anything with. This problem is solved with the cookie package from npm . It can be installed with the regular npm i cookie command. Getting a list of our available cookies is easy with cookie.parse . But first, let's talk about setting cookies. In fact, you don't even need the cookie package to do this. You simply write something like this in your browser console: document.cookie = \"loggedIn=true;Max-Age=60*1000\" + Enter The Max-Age property decides how long the cookie will live for/be valid for. This property is counted in milliseconds so if you want the cookie to last one minute, you have to use 60*1000 , (1000 milliseconds = 1 second; 1 second X 60 = 1 minute) . In React & Node world, we can use the cookie package to write simple cookies as well. It will look something like this: Setting cookies using the cookie package 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 import cookie from \"cookie\" ; // Or // const cookie = require(\"cookie\"); // Set a new cookie document . cookie = cookie . serialize ( \"loggedIn\" , \"true\" , { maxAge : 1000 * 60 }); // Delete a cookie document . cookie = cookie . serialize ( \"loggedIn\" , null , { maxAge : 0 }); // To check your new cookies console . log ( cookie . parse ( document . cookie )); The cookie.serialize() method takes in 3 parameters: the key , the value , then an Object that takes in some key/value pairs as options. The list of options when using the cookie package can be found here . Setting the maxAge attribute to 0, or a negative number, will delete the cookie from memory. So now we've set this cookie on Login which means at Logout we'll want to clear it. Keep this in mind as we move forward because we're going to continue working on the Login in portion for now. NOTE: Without the cookie package, we would need to do some extra work in order to get our cookies to be more readable and usable. By default, document.cookie will return a concatenated string with all our key/values separated by a semi-colon. This makes it hard for us to extract the right bit of information we need. The npm package, cookie , simplifies that process for us, making it more practical. Lets take a look at what it looks like to get a cookie without that cookie package. Cookies without NPM cookie - without comments 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 document . cookie = \"loggedin=true;Max-Age=1000*60\" ; document . cookie = \"anotherKey=anotherValue;Max-Age=1000*60\" ; let cookies = {}; document . cookie . split ( \";\" ). forEach (( el ) => { let keyValue = el . split ( \"=\" ); return ( cookies [ keyValue [ 0 ]] = keyValue [ 1 ]); }); Cookies without NPM cookie - with comments 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 // Set some cookies document . cookie = \"loggedin=true;Max-Age=1000*60\" ; document . cookie = \"anotherKey=anotherValue;Max-Age=1000*60\" ; // Create an object called `cookies` which will be used to store our key / values AFTER we break them down let cookies = {}; // Get cookies by calling to the cookie method on the document: // \"document.cookie\" document . cookie // \"loggedin=true;anotherKey=anotherValue // Split that concatenated string of joined key/values at the semicolons // and place it into an array . split ( \";\" ) // returns [\"loggedin=false\", \"anotherKey=anotherValue\"] // For each element in our new Array of strings . forEach (( el ) => { // Split the element AT the \"equal\" sign let keyValue = el . split ( \"=\" ); // [\"loggedin\", \"false\"] // And for every element, we return a new key/value pair and attach it // to our cookies object we create first return ( cookies [ keyValue [ 0 ]] = keyValue [ 1 ]); // At the end we get an object with 2 key values, which is much easier // to work with: // {loggedin: \"true\", anotherKey: \"anotherValue\"} }); Want to know more about cookies and what you can do with them?

To make this happen we'll need to create a function that \"watches\" when a user becomes authenticated. In the last project you implemented a sign-in procedure that stores the user's information but now we need another function that watches that action and gives the okay for the rest of the components to be rendered. AND, when the user signs off this same function will disconnect our app from the Firebase database. We'll call this function the observer function or listening function. Authentication State Observer In our code we'll name this \"listening\" function onAuthStateChanged() . See, Firebase has a lot of awesome functions in their library that make our job as developers easier to implement authentication. This onAuthStateChanged() function from Firebase will keep an eye-on whether or not someone has logged-in or -out and. Let's take a look at how that works. Implement onAuthStateChanged() In your Authenticate with Firebase project, add the following code to your App component. Add onAuthStateChanged() to App.js to Setup Authentication 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 // be sure to import useEffect import React , { useState , useEffect } from 'react' ; // auth and createUser imports go here import { onAuthStateChanged } from 'firebase/auth' function App () { // All of the previous Hooks: registeredEmail/Password, // setEmail/Password go here const [ user , setUser ] = useState ({}); // Your register(), logout(), clearForm() methods & the // console.log(\"auth.currentUser\") go here. useEffect (()=> { const unsubscribe = onAuthStateChanged ( auth , ( currentUser ) => { console . log ( \"currentUser\" , currentUser ); setUser ( currentUser ); }); console . log ( \"unsubscribe\" , unsubscribe ); return unsubscribe // We only want 1 instance of the user connected to // the database this cleans up and disconnects the // observer function when component is unmounted. }, []) return ( < div > // Rest of form and inputs go here < /div> ) } export default App ; What's going on with this \"Observer\" Function? The useEffect() hook is called during the initial mounting of the component. It will create a reference, named unsubscribe , to the function onAuthStateChanged() which is the observer function. Inside of this observer function we pass two arguments: auth and a anonymous function. auth is coming from our src/firebase-config.js file when we wrote: 1 2 3 const auth = getAuth ( app ); export default auth Notice the function used there: getAuth() and the argument passed to it: app . app is an object that represents your Firebase app. It's created by passing your unique firebaseConfig object to the initializeApp() function. 1 const app = initializeApp ( firebaseConfig ); From there the onAuthStateChanged() function's second argument is an anonymous function which is passed a parameter called currentUser . This currentUser represents any user who logs in. Next, this anonymous function logs to the console our currentUser but more importantly calls setUser to set the user as currentUser . The user object is then tracked in state and can be passed around your app via props to check for authorized access. Just like the checkAuth() function from the Protected Routes lesson , we'll use this check to see if the user is allowed to see that page they're requesting. The beauty of having this \"observer\" function is that we now have a single source of truth telling our app who is logged in and when but also, it now has an active observer function that is able to unsubscribe /disconnect our app from Firebase when needed(when a user logs-off). Lastly, the onAuthStateChanged() returns an unsubscribe function we save to a variable called: unsubscribe . This will allow the useEffect() hook to run unsubscribe() as a cleanup function whenever the component unmounts, effectively deleting the connection to Firebase. That was a lot so don't get intimidated if it didn't sink in the first time. Implement into Protected Route Now that we understand this observer function, let's make it change views when it notices a user has logged-in or -out. Let's start with our ProtectedRoute component(function) then we'll move to the Router component. While learning about Protected Routes we saw code that looked like this: A Simple Protected Route - ProtectedRoute.js 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 import { Navigate } from \"react-router-dom\" ; const ProtectedRoute = ( props ) => { export const { component : Component , ... rest } = props ; return ( checkAuth () === true ? ( < Component {... rest } /> ) : ( < Navigate to = \"/login\" /> ) ); }; In it we need to replace the current \"dummy\" logic of checkAuth() with something a little more useful: Protected Route based on User - ProtectedRoute.js w/o comments 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 import { Navigate } from \"react-router-dom\" ; export const ProtectedRoute = ( props ) => { const { component : Component , user , ... rest } = props ; return !! user ? < Component {... rest } /> : < Navigate to = \"/\" /> ; }; Protected Route based on User - ProtectedRoute.js w/comments 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 // import the Navigate function to change the user's address bar import { Navigate } from \"react-router-dom\" ; // create a function called ProtectedRoute that will determine if a user // is logged in or not and serve up the component they asked for or // Navigate them to the Home/Login component export const ProtectedRoute = ( props ) => { // `props` captures anything passed to this function for it's parent // destructure the props so the pieces can easily be referenced: // `component:` will equal `Component` and `user:` will equal // `user` but spread(...) the `rest` of the props out as well. const { component : Component , user , ... rest } = props ; // if there is a `user` return the `Component` requested but if // not (:) `Navigate` them to the Home(\"/\") return !! user ? < Component {... rest } /> : < Navigate to = \"/\" /> ; }; Navigate to your ProtectedRoute component /component/ProtectedRoutes.js In your destructured object that is coming from props , include the user property which will be passed down by it's parent container( Router ). Instead of that simple checkAuth() function, we are going to check whether the user object, which is being passed down from the onAuthStateChanged function, actually exists as an object with data about the user, or does the object not exist and is actually null a.k.a. \"we do not have an authenticated user\". We do this by checking the !! double bang operator . NOTE: !! is a double bang . It's used when you want the falsey value of something. Try entering !null in your Chrome console and you'll get true . NOTE-2: Since the user object will either be null or an object, we want to get the falsey value if the user is truly null . So we will use !!null , since it is easier to reason that we want a null value to represent false . Implement into Router Now that we have our ProtectedRoute looking for a user object, we can bring it into our Router function to be used to protect certain routes! Use the ProtectedRoute in Router - Router.js w/o comments 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 import { Routes , Router } from \"react-router-dom\" ; import { ProtectedRoute } from './components/ProtectedRoute' ; import Home from \"./components/Home\" ; import Dashboard from \"./components/Dashboard\" ; const Router = ( props ) => { const user = { props }; return ( < Routes > < Route exact path = \"/\" component = { Home } /> < Route path = '/about' element = { < ProtectedRoute user = { user } component = { about } /> } /> < /Routes> ) } export default Router ; Use the ProtectedRoute in Router - Router.js w/comments 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 import { Routes , Router } from \"react-router-dom\" ; // bring in the ProtectedRoute function so it can be used. import { ProtectedRoute } from './components/ProtectedRoute' ; // bring in all of the components that can be routed to import Home from \"./components/Home\" ; import Dashboard from \"./components/Dashboard\" ; // give the parameter `props` to the `Router` so it has a reference to // an arguments passed to it from up the chain. const Router = ( props ) => { // In the `props` will be a property called `user` because it was sent // by `onAuthStateChanged` from `App.js`.

We will destructure user object from the props object being passed, as we have done before. Last, just make sure you include that user as a property to be passed down to our ProtectedRoute component so it can be read by the logic of the ProtectedRoute If you followed along correctly, the <Dashboard /> component will be protected and only be shown based on some condition like is there a user?

React Router provides its own linking mechanism that ensures interaction with our <Router> and <Routes> paths we created at the beginning of the homework. One of the great things about this component is that we can use it anywhere in our code. To do so, we need to import it first: import { Link } from 'react-router-dom' . (Maybe you're picking up on the pattern now?)

The Link component at its simplest, just takes a prop called to which represents the path you want to navigate to .

It helps us build a dynamic single-page application (SPA), but so far our app literally just has one page. What if we want it to have more than one? Like a sign-up page, contact us page, products page, whatever!! That's where React Router comes in. With React Router we can control the URL in the address bar and tell our server to return the file that matches the URL we just changed it to. For instance: \"www.mywebsite.com/contactus\" might return the \"Contact Us\" page whereas \"www.mywebsite.com/signup\" might return the \"Sign Up\" page. Continue on to get the low down on how to make this work. Why Why use React Router? As we mentioned above, we use React Router to help us handle multiple routes in our URL. For example, every time you spin up your music dashboard app using npm start it sends the browser to the default path of the application in your computer ~/devFolder/musicApp/ , or simply, ~/ . Through the local port 3000 it shows up in your browser as \"http://localhost:3000/\" . But later, when we add a users page and want the route /users registered with our app's Router so the browser will navigate to the Users component that we built, we use React Router. Thus, we will have the following paths match the following components: / -> HomePage Component /users -> Users Component /users/0 -> UserDetails Component with the details of our first user React Router: The High Overview Video Breakdown App Demo What's going on How?

We don't use <Switch> anymore. It is now <Routes> VIDEO-NOTE-2: This video was recorded before React v18 and the rendering method for React is now ReactDOM.createRoot() which is imported from \"react-dom/client\". See code snippet below. 1 2 3 4 5 6 import ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\" ; import \"./index.css\" ; import App from \"./App\" ; const root = ReactDOM . createRoot ( document . getElementById ( \"root\" )); root . render ( < App /> ); VIDEO-NOTE-3: With React Router v6, after ReactDOM you'll import tools(functions) from only react-router-dom not react-router . What Install the Router Packages So how do we integrate React Router into our code? It's actually quite simple . . . it's an NPM package just like Material UI! Who would have thought?!? To install it in our project we just run the command npm i react-router react-router-dom inside our React app. This command installs two packages, as you may have noticed, react-router and react-router-dom. Go ahead and do that in your music app. It should be noted at this point that all forms of building front-end applications will need the use of a \"router\" of some shape and form. If you were building with Angular you'd need to use Angular's RouterModule and Routes . If you were building with Vue you'd need to use Vue Router . They all do the same job in their respective stacks, so while we're learning to build with React, let's use React Router . Creating the Router After installing the libraries/packages that make up the magic of React Router, we need to create a router, which really is just a function that, when called, returns the component it's assigned to. We start by creating a file called Router.js , usually right inside the src/ folder. Here's an example of a simple Router file: src/Router.js 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 import React from 'react' ; // Here is where we are importing to the two main components we need from the React Router package. import { Routes , Route } from 'react-router-dom' ; // Local imports. Import components we built ourselves import Home from './Home' ; import Dashboard from './components/Dashboard' ; import Profile from './components/Profile' ; const Router = () => { return ( { /* Then we use Routes and Route. Routes acts like a regular JS Switch* Statement */ } < Routes > { /* depending on the path in the URL, one of these Routes will be returned and their component rendered */ } < Route path = \"/*\" element = { < Home /> } /> < Route path = \"/dash\" element = { < Dashboard /> } /> < Route path = \"/user/:id\" element = { < Profile /> } /> < /Routes> ); } //Don't forget to export your newly create Router component export default Router ; NOTE: When using the * at the end of a path it means to match deeply or exactly. We can only use * at the end of a path, make sure to never use it at the start or middle of a path(security errors will occur). You'll only need the trailing * when there is another <Routes> somewhere in that route's descendant tree. In that case, the descendant <Routes> will match on the portion of the pathname that remains. The Routes component always wraps multiple Route 's, so it is the single parent container this component returns. The Route 's are relative and help with leaner and more predictable code. Route 's are chosen based on the best match, not in order. You can put your Route 's in any order you like, the router will detect the best route for the current URL automatically. For readability if you want to start with \"home\" thats fine but nothing to worry about if you don't. NOTE: As we customize the \"Router\" component, keep in mind the Routes component bares an obvious resemblance in appearance and functionality to the switch() { case: } . In summary, Routes is telling the application, \"hey, look at all of the paths in this section to see if the current path in the browser matches any of these. If so, return the route that's connected to it.\" The Route then, is a component which specifies a combination of the correct relationship of \"path\" and \"component\". If the URL in the browser matches the path, then the Route sends the application to the correct component. In this case, /dash will load up the Dashboard component. You see the <Route> is the case: statement that says to do this when this is the case. Remember to Import the Components You Want to Use 1 2 3 4 5 6 // You need to use the Home component in the Route component you must import the Home component first import Home from './Home' < Routes > < Route path = \"/\" element = { < Home /> } /> < /Routes> This might seem obvious but it's an important piece to remember. Each of the components you want to use in your Router have to be imported so they're available/registered with the Router component. Also, notice that we used the Home component as the default route. If we're using Router we have to create a default case for the <Routes> component to return, because ALL components in React must return something !!! Rendering What Comes out of the Router Great, so we've created our Router file. Now what? Let's tell the application to use it! Remember, we created the file but haven't made the other parts of the application aware of it. The very first file of our app, the index.js file is our entry point into the app. Go to it and find the component it's currently using, which is most likely <App /> . We're going to make some renovations. Look below at the default setup of our app. Basic React index.js File 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 import React from 'react' ; import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client' ; import './index.css' ; import App from './App' ; import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals' ; const root = ReactDOM . createRoot ( document . getElementById ( 'root' )); root . render ( < React . StrictMode > < App /> < /React.StrictMode> ); // If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function // to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log)) // or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals reportWebVitals (); NOTE: Don't worry about the reportWebVitals part. It is an API which we can learn to use later. Just focus on the steps ahead. As you probably guessed, we have to import things . . .The first (#1) is BrowserRouter . This, aptly named, package navigates the browser where we want it to. The second (#2) step we have to import is the Router component we just finished building. React index.js File with BrowserRouter & Our Router imported 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 import React from 'react' ; import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client' ; // #1 import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom' ; import './index.css' ; import App from './App' ; import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals' ; // #2 import Router from './Router' ; // ...more code below here... NOTE: The order in which packages and components are imported is not important to the app. The order is only important to you and your team, so find a style you like and develop it. In the example above you'll see package dependencies listed first, then styles, then components. Next, or #3 , we have to create a component to return this stuff for us. Let's call it Main and have it return <BrowserRouter> . Then stick our <Router /> component inside of it. This \"sticking\" inside is actually called \"wrapping\". We \"wrap\" the <BrowserRouter> around the <Router> so our entire application is encapsulated by the <BrowserRouter> . Newly Created Main Component in the index.js File 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 // ...more code above here... import Router from './Router' ; const root = ReactDOM . createRoot ( document . getElementById ( \"root\" )); // #3 const Main = () => ( < BrowserRouter > < Router /> < /BrowserRouter> ); root . render ( < App /> ); // ...more code about service worker blah blah below here... The fourth(#4) step is to use the \"wrap\". To do this we'll pass the Main component we just built to the root.render() method. Now our app's index.js file should look like this: Replaced <App /> with <Main /> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 import React from 'react' ; // #1 import ReactDOM from 'react-dom' ; import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom' ; import './index.css' ; import reportWebVitals from \"./reportWebVitals\" ; // We no longer need our App component to be imported here... // #2 import Router from './Router' ; const root = ReactDOM . createRoot ( document . getElementById ( \"root\" )); // #3 const Main = () => ( < BrowserRouter > < Router /> < /BrowserRouter> ); // #4 root . render ( < Main /> ); // If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function // to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log)) // or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals reportWebVitals (); We call this \"wrapping\" stuff Higher Order Components or HOCs because, just like the Higher Order functions ( .map , .reduce , .filter ) you learned in 211, they take functions as their arguments and sometimes return functions: root.render() takes in Main which returns BrowserRouter which returns Router with returns one of the Routes which returns its appropriate component which then returns the JSX so the render can plug it into the DOM inside an element with the id \"root\" . Get it? If not, walk through that again slowly. Draw it out. Notes on this React Router/BrowserRouter stuff: Be sure to import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom' , Step 1 It is key that this { BrowserRouter } wraps our application because it is needed for the communication between our browser and our Router component. Additionally, when we take a look a the React Link component (coming up) we will learn that Link s can only be used inside of a \"router\" which BrowserRouter takes care of for us. Please note: You don't have to understand that right now, just start recognizing the pattern we are using above. Components return components that return components or, more simply, a function returns a function that returns a function. Functional programming! Remember to import your custom Router component, import Router from './Router' so it can be used in the index.js file, Step 2 . In Step 3 , we created a small component function called Main (you can call it something else if you like) and we wrapped our <Router /> inside the <BrowserRouter> </BrowserRouter> tags so the BrowserRouter component returns it. You may be thinking, \"couldn't we have just done that in the Router file?\". Yes, but this pattern will allow you to eventually add components around the router that you want to see on every page. For example, a Header and Footer component, like you see below: Example of Main Component 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 const Main = () => ( < BrowserRouter > { /*You can use basic HTML elements to wrap your custom components so that you are in line with conventional semantic structural practices*/ } < header > < HeaderComponent /> < /header> < main > < Router /> { /* <-- See? Your different routes can be render here while still keeping the Header and Footer the same */ } < /main> < footer > < FooterComponent /> < /footer> < /BrowserRouter> ) But do NOTE that you may see slightly different patterns in other tutorials and that's perfectly fine. While you're learning, let's stick with this pattern. You can explore and diverge later on. Step 4 is simply replacing the call to App in root.render with the new Main function we just created. Once this step is done you should be able to load up your application and switch between the Home and Dashboard components by typing the corresponding URL in the browser. But of course, typing in that URL is annoying and you're definitely not asked to do that on anyone else's web site. To fix this let's learn how to use the Link part of React Router which is a programmatic way to switch the browser URL.

Draw it out.","title":"Rendering What Comes out of the Router"},{"location":"module-2/reactRouter/#notes-on-this-react-routerbrowserrouter-stuff","text":"Be sure to import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom' , Step 1 It is key that this { BrowserRouter } wraps our application because it is needed for the communication between our browser and our Router component. Additionally, when we take a look a the React Link component (coming up) we will learn that Link s can only be used inside of a \"router\" which BrowserRouter takes care of for us. Please note: You don't have to understand that right now, just start recognizing the pattern we are using above. Components return components that return components or, more simply, a function returns a function that returns a function. Functional programming! Remember to import your custom Router component, import Router from './Router' so it can be used in the index.js file, Step 2 . In Step 3 , we created a small component function called Main (you can call it something else if you like) and we wrapped our <Router /> inside the <BrowserRouter> </BrowserRouter> tags so the BrowserRouter component returns it. You may be thinking, \"couldn't we have just done that in the Router file?\". Yes, but this pattern will allow you to eventually add components around the router that you want to see on every page. For example, a Header and Footer component, like you see below: Example of Main Component 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 const Main = () => ( < BrowserRouter > { /*You can use basic HTML elements to wrap your custom components so that you are in line with conventional semantic structural practices*/ } < header > < HeaderComponent /> < /header> < main > < Router /> { /* <-- See? Your different routes can be render here while still keeping the Header and Footer the same */ } < /main> < footer > < FooterComponent /> < /footer> < /BrowserRouter> ) But do NOTE that you may see slightly different patterns in other tutorials and that's perfectly fine. While you're learning, let's stick with this pattern. You can explore and diverge later on. Step 4 is simply replacing the call to App in root.render with the new Main function we just created. Once this step is done you should be able to load up your application and switch between the Home and Dashboard components by typing the corresponding URL in the browser. But of course, typing in that URL is annoying and you're definitely not asked to do that on anyone else's web site. To fix this let's learn how to use the Link part of React Router which is a programmatic way to switch the browser URL.","title":"Notes on this React Router/BrowserRouter stuff:"},{"location":"module-2/reactRouter/#know-your-docs","text":"w3S Docs - Switch Statement w3S Docs - React Router React Training Docs - React Router React Router Docs - Quick Start React Router Docs - React Router v6 React Router Docs - Upgrading from v5","title":"Know Your Docs"},{"location":"module-3/authorizationWithFirebase/","text":"Authorization with Firebase Now that we've learned how to use Serverless Functions (FireBase Cloud functions) to pass data back and forth between our front-end and back-end let's see another way we can use them.

In our case it's Node.js . We are going to use a combination of built in methods and Node.js to create a function that is callable from the front-end. Again we are doing a very similar thing to any API you have called before except we are not using fetch or axios ; we'll be using built in FireBase methods.

When a user signs in they can be assigned a role. To do that we will add a createRole function in the file where our user signs up and invokes the register function. Note: Below userCredential?.user is using object chaining it enables you to read the value of a property located on an object without having to check if the property exists first.

In order to locally run React and these cloud functions both at the same you will need to run two terminals at the same time. In VSCode click the Terminal menu and select New Terminal. Alternatively, press the + button at the top of your terminal emulator to create a new session. The first terminal will stay in the root directory to run your React app: npm run start The second terminal should be in the functions folder: cd functions then firebase emulators:start . Sign up a new user and look at the object under claims. You'll see that the user now has teacher:true . You should see the same on the back-end and front-end since we setup a console.log statement and return value. The next step is to check for the existence of the teacher:true in the user object. Then putting the correct check in areas you want to restrict to certain types of users. You will be setting that up in the next assignment.

Overview For the past few classes we've talked about how to connect the client (frontend) to a server (back-end API). This connection is essential to providing the user with data. Often times the data provided to users comes from many APIs. Perhaps your app provides the user with good hunting land entrances from the database you control but you'd also like to give them relevant weather conditions. To do that it would be best to use another's weather API such as DarkSky , WeatherUnderground , or others . If you wanted other services like traffic, sunrise, water temps or water depth you'd need to bring in services from other APIs. Perhaps you can start to see how these relatively small apps can become very large projects. In the next few weeks you'll have class time dedicated to planning and building your Capstone App with the help of your instructor. It's important to understand that planning is more important than building/coding. Why? Because if you start coding your focus will be too narrow, just one line at a time. But if you start planning your focus is from higher up with an overview perspective of the app and you can make better decisions about what needs to done, when. Once you've planned from this higher perspective you can zoom into specific problems as you need to code them out but zoom back out when you need to see everything as a whole. It would be wise to think of this zooming in and zooming out process as a necessary skill you must practice to be successful at building not only your app for graduation but also when building software for a client or your company. System Design System design is the process of designing the elements of a system such as the architecture, modules and components, the different interfaces of those components and the data that goes through that system. System design is a high level view of what the application will look like, and how the application should work in the end. Read It - System Design System design can be broken up into 3 categories: the client, services, and database. The client is what we will focus on today as you've already built most of your database and server in 311. It should also be stated that system design is not React specific, it is for all applications and for any library or framework you choose to build in. These are some questions to consider when developing any client application. What does my app actually do? What core functions does my app perform to do this? How will the user interact with the app? How can I build the app so that it is scalable? This is to say, how can I plan to create variables to be referenced and reused by multiple parts of the system and how can I build components to be reused as much as possible? Also, how can I can make my app responsive? For a deeper understanding of System Design from a very high-level, read over this article on 10 Practical tips for Getting Your Clients Design System off to a Great Start . Practice It On a sheet of paper, design a login component to an application (maybe the one you've built already?). The app will need to have a: Sign-on page Service that checks if user is in database A home page after the user is authorized Seriously , take the time now to draw out on paper what the component looks like to the user. Then draw the services behind the component. Then draw the database. Now the server and the routes it will use to authorize the user. Then the logic of moving the user from the sign in to the home page. It doesn't matter what it looks like so long as you actually did it. The visualization of this process will help you build this in the future much, much faster!! And with less bugs and headaches Core Functionality Today will you be your first day to work with a teammate and your instructor to begin planning your Capstone App. Take the time now to WRITE your ideas, plan, functionalities, and diagrams out. Your teammate will do the same thing and you both can work much faster. In the next few classes and homeworks we'll work through steps for you to successfully and quickly build a Capstone App that demonstrates your programming abilities. Work through the first three now. Step 0: Pick an Idea, Pick a Partner By now you should have a reasonable idea of an app you\u2019d like to build for your Capstone Project. After all, you\u2019ve been pitching to your classmates what you\u2019d like to build and discussing with your instructors the app you\u2019d like to build, and building a database for it. For these last two weeks of your 400 level class, it would be best to partner with someone else, especially if you like frontend and they like backend or vice versa. Working with someone else will prove hugely beneficial for your first web app. Which brings us to the first and main point: This is your first web app! You\u2019re going to make mistakes. You\u2019re going to want to beat your head against the keyboard , you\u2019re going to struggle, and you may even cry. All of this is part of the process. After this app you\u2019ll have learned lessons you\u2019ll want to carry on with you to your next app and your next job. Good Coding Bad Coding No GIF What\u2019s important now is that you commit yourself to building, mentally and physically! Below you\u2019ll find a list of tasks for you to do that, if followed, will bring this figment of imagination in your mind to fruition, to the world, for all to see and use. You are about to embark on the truest gift of programmers: materializing previously unrealized ideas of solutions for the world to use. Step 1: List out the Core Functions of Your App Now that you\u2019ve decided on the app you want to build and the teammate you\u2019d like to have for this courageous adventure, let\u2019s list out the core features/functions of your app. To do this, think of the core functions of any app you use now like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, SnapChat, YouTube, etc. For our sake, we\u2019ll use Reddit. Core Functions of Reddit users can create an account users can retrieve lost passwords users can change their passwords users can post new links users can comment on links users can upvote/downvote links users have a profile showing their history activity While we could name a few other functions, we are only naming CORE FUNCTIONALITY . Please don\u2019t stray away from these core functions. You are a beginner and all you need right now is to build your first app with simple CORE functionality. Once you\u2019ve built each of the functions you and your teammate list out in this step you can add new features on top. BUT NOT UNTIL AFTER YOU\u2019VE BUILT THE CORE FUNCTIONS. For an example of an actual Capstone Project, we\u2019ll use Budget App by Selena Solis and Nurzat Nijat. The purpose of this app was to easily translate and budget currency using the latest exchange rates for Nurzat, who just immigrated to the US and Selena who recently visited Iceland. At graduation, their app's functionality included: Users could create an account Users could sign in Users could create a budget Users could select the currency of their budget Users could enter an item and the cost in a specific currency The user\u2019s budget would be subtracted using the chosen currency I\u2019m sure after graduation they went on to add a few features like: multiple budgets, profiles, geolocation, password reset, and design. What\u2019s important here is that the app was functional at its core. So should yours. Step 2: Simplify Your Core Functionality s Please, please , please take time to look at your \u201ccore functionality\u201d and decide what you can cut. There are pieces that you\u2019ve listed that could easily be implemented later. Ask your teammate to take a serious look at the function you want your app to perform and decide what can wait for later.

These are some questions to consider when developing any client application. What does my app actually do? What core functions does my app perform to do this? How will the user interact with the app? How can I build the app so that it is scalable? This is to say, how can I plan to create variables to be referenced and reused by multiple parts of the system and how can I build components to be reused as much as possible? Also, how can I can make my app responsive? For a deeper understanding of System Design from a very high-level, read over this article on 10 Practical tips for Getting Your Clients Design System off to a Great Start .","title":"Read It - System Design"},{"location":"module-3/capstoneApp-planning-pt1/#practice-it","text":"On a sheet of paper, design a login component to an application (maybe the one you've built already?). The app will need to have a: Sign-on page Service that checks if user is in database A home page after the user is authorized Seriously , take the time now to draw out on paper what the component looks like to the user. Then draw the services behind the component. Then draw the database. Now the server and the routes it will use to authorize the user. Then the logic of moving the user from the sign in to the home page. It doesn't matter what it looks like so long as you actually did it.

After all, you\u2019ve been pitching to your classmates what you\u2019d like to build and discussing with your instructors the app you\u2019d like to build, and building a database for it. For these last two weeks of your 400 level class, it would be best to partner with someone else, especially if you like frontend and they like backend or vice versa. Working with someone else will prove hugely beneficial for your first web app. Which brings us to the first and main point: This is your first web app! You\u2019re going to make mistakes. You\u2019re going to want to beat your head against the keyboard , you\u2019re going to struggle, and you may even cry. All of this is part of the process.

Once you\u2019ve built each of the functions you and your teammate list out in this step you can add new features on top. BUT NOT UNTIL AFTER YOU\u2019VE BUILT THE CORE FUNCTIONS. For an example of an actual Capstone Project, we\u2019ll use Budget App by Selena Solis and Nurzat Nijat. The purpose of this app was to easily translate and budget currency using the latest exchange rates for Nurzat, who just immigrated to the US and Selena who recently visited Iceland. At graduation, their app's functionality included: Users could create an account Users could sign in Users could create a budget Users could select the currency of their budget Users could enter an item and the cost in a specific currency The user\u2019s budget would be subtracted using the chosen currency I\u2019m sure after graduation they went on to add a few features like: multiple budgets, profiles, geolocation, password reset, and design.

If you followed along in the previous lesson, you should have initiated your database and created your first collection along with its first document. Hopefully you also add in a couple extra documents yourself since we are now going to read those documents from the client side. Although we created some data using the FireStore dashboard, we also want to be able to create data from the client. In this lesson, we are going to go more into depth about those basic CRUD operations we spoke about in the previous lesson. Remember, CRUD is the acronym to C reate, R ead, U pdate, and D elete data. We are going to connect our database instance with a React app and go over these CRUD operations together. Connect React App & FireStore We are going to begin by first R eading some data, so I encourage you to make sure you have some data stored in a collection on your FireStore database instance, and if not, you can skip down to the C reate portion of this lesson to create some data. But, in order to begin, we need to go back into our Firebase config file and create some new instances, so lets start there. Config At this point, you should have already set up a configuration file before. We are going to be using that same file for most things Firebase related, including both Auth and now Firestore . If you are starting a new project, we can use the same information from our previous config file, assuming you are still working on that same Firebase project, or update the configuration information with any new information. You can also find this information on your Firebase console under your projects settings, under the General settings tab. Finding Configuration File - 1 Finding Configuration File - 2 Finding Configuration File - 3 On your config file, we simply need to add two things. We want to import getFireStore from firebase/firestore , then we want to create an instance of our database ( db ) using getFirestore . Then we're going to export this so we can use it in other files of our project, where we will be making requests to our database. Your configuration file should look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 import { initializeApp } from \"firebase/app\" ; import { getAuth } from \"firebase/auth\" ; import { getFirestore } from \"firebase/firestore\" ; const firebaseConfig = { apiKey : process . env . REACT_APP_API_KEY , authDomain : process . env . REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN , projectId : process . env . REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID , storageBucket : process . env . REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET , messagingSenderId : process . env . REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID , appId : process . env . REACT_APP_APP_ID , measurementId : process . env . REACT_APP_MEASUREMENT_ID , }; // initialize firebase const app = initializeApp ( firebaseConfig ); // initialize auth export const auth = getAuth ( app ); // initialize FireStore export const db = getFirestore ( app ); Be sure to add: import { getFirestore } from \"firebase/firestore\" Then add: export const db = getFirestore(app) R ead / GET Now that we have instantiated our db with our Firebase project, we can now use that instance to make requests to that database. Remember those documents you created in the previous lesson? Let's see if we can make a request to our DB and R ead those documents. In order to get a list of all the documents of a collection , we need to first import some functions from the firebase/firestore library. We are going to import collection to make a reference to the collection we are trying to request data from, and getDocs to get a list of all documents in that collection . Getting a List of Documents 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 // import our 'db' instance from our 'config' file import { db } from './firebase/config' // import collection and getDocs from 'firebase/firestore import { collection , getDocs } from \"firebase/firestore\" ; // Create a reference to the db and the collection we want to use, this // example is the \"video_games\" collection. Please substitute this with // a collection in your database. const collectionRef = collection ( db , \"video_games\" ) // Now that we have a reference, let's get all the documents from that // collection `getDocs` returns a promise, so lets wait for it to resolve const results = await getDocs ( collectionRef ) // We now need to go through each document in our results and invoke a // function that is returned to us from FireStore to actually see the data results . docs . forEach ( doc => { // for each 'doc', we'll console log an object with it's own id and spread // the object that is returned to us by called the 'doc.data()' function // with our actual data console . log ({ id : doc . id , ... doc . data () }) }) // See next slide to see a more robust example using React... useEffect Example 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 import React , { useEffect , useState } from \"react\" ; import { collection , getDocs } from \"firebase/firestore\" ; import { db } from \"../firebase/config\" ; const List = () => { const [ data , setData ] = useState ( null ); useEffect (() => { const getCollection = async () => { const ref = collection ( db , \"video_games\" ); let { docs } = await getDocs ( ref ); let list = [] docs . forEach (( doc ) => { list . push ({ id : doc . id , ... doc . data () }) }); setData ( list ) }; getCollection () }, []); // We're using useEffect here so we can monitor any changes // made to our 'data' state useEffect (()=>{ console . log ( 'effect:' , data ) }, [ data ]) // data inside our dependency array return < div > This is the listing page < /div>; }; export default List ; Once you get your list, make sure you render your List component to map through the data and display the list however you'd like. Next, we are moving on to C reating data. C reate / POST Creating new data for our FireStore DB is pretty simple. You will take everything you have learned about React thus far, such as setting some state and handling events , and implement FireStore's simple methods to write some new data. Again, we will be using our db instance, and we'll be importing two things from firebase/firestore , addDoc and collection . We can also import Timestamp if we are using FireStore's own version of Timestamp . NOTE: We could create our own timestamp in JS but would just need to do a little extra work to convert our regular timestamp to the FireStore Timestamp . Follow along with the high overview example below, followed by a practical React use case. Creating a Document 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 // import our 'db' instance from our 'config' file import { db } from './firebase/config' // import collection, addDoc, and Timestamp from 'firebase/firestore import { collection , addDoc , Timestamp } from \"firebase/firestore\" ; // Again, we will create a reference, but this time we will be doing // something a little different. When we refer to a collection that DOES // NOT EXIST in the DB, one will be created for us. This makes it simple // to add a collection from anywhere. In this example, we'll be creating // a new table called 'books const collectionRef = collection ( db , \"books\" ) // Now we have a reference to a collection (that is yet to exist). Let's // create a new document in this new collection by using our `addDoc` // function. Again, this returns a Promise, so let's wait for it to resolve. // `addDoc` takes two parameters, the collection and an Object with the new // data we want to add to the document.

We created some data and stored it in our FireStore DB. You can create as many collections as needed, all with their own documents that serve the needs of your App. You might want to store a collection of books, cars, video games, blog posts, users ... you get the point. As we move on through this course, keep your Capstone idea in mind as you will be creating these collections in a similar manner. Document-Oriented Database At this point, it's important to talk about consistency in our data. Since FireStore is NOT a Relational Database such as SQL , which stores data into tables, columns, and rows, FireStore is a little more relaxed when it comes to creating data; meaning you can create multiple documents of various shapes (different values and data types). FireStore is a NoSQL , document-oriented database, which allows us to have different fields in a document within a collection, meaning, the documents can have completely different data from one to the next. Although you are allowed to do this, it is important to keep in mind that you want consistent data through your data so you can depend on on the data structure of each document to be like the last. In addition, this can create errors down the line when you are expecting a certain field in every document and all of a sudden a document doesn't have an expected field. Check out the images below: Consistent Collection NOTE: Keeping your database consistent will better help serve your app's when you are building the client-side. So, if a field expects an Object or an Array, make sure to be specify that it does when creating new documents from the client-side. This will make for a reliable data structures and better flow. Inconsistent Collection NOTE: Do you see the difference between \"DocumentA\" and \"DocumentB\"? The fields are different! Although very similar this can create lots of havoc for you later down the line. Even though you can create different data structures across the documents in a collection, this is strongly discouraged as you might run into unexpected later. Your app will be designed to render the data from these collections, and they will need to be consistent, dependable, and reliable across the board in order to function properly. As the saying goes, \"Just because you can, doesn't mean you should\" , applies to the way we model our documents inside our collections. Even though we can create completely different documents, do we really want to? Most of the data that will be stored into a FireStore DB will come from our client-side, where we will specify exactly what will be going into every document as it is created by the user. So there should not be much to worry about, after all, we are developers. Summary We should now have a basic understanding on how to C reate and R ead documents.

You can also find this information on your Firebase console under your projects settings, under the General settings tab. Finding Configuration File - 1 Finding Configuration File - 2 Finding Configuration File - 3 On your config file, we simply need to add two things. We want to import getFireStore from firebase/firestore , then we want to create an instance of our database ( db ) using getFirestore .

These next couple of lessons will introduce a new service from Firebase called Firestore which will allow us to store data like products, businesses, or whatever your Capstone app may need to a database. This data will be stored as records called collections , and these \"collections\" will have several more records within each collection called documents . We will be creating a client side UI which will enable us to make queries to this database of collections to not only read these documents, but display it to the user as well. We will also be implementing a way to to create , update , or delete these documents or collections on our Database. But, before we get into Firestore , we want to talk about fundamentals of Database Management Systems and the basic operations we use to obtain and mutate / change data called CRUD . By the end of your course and by graduation you will have built a full-stack CRUD app so let's get to learning about what these guys are. What's CRUD? CRUD is an acronym that stands for C reate, R ead, U pdate, and D elete. In its simplest forms, any Software Application that consists of these four basic operations can be considered a CRUD application. C stands for the creation of data or the entry of a new piece of data like when you want to create a new user or product. R stands for the reading of the data. Think when you want to show a feed you'll need to make a read request to read the data in the database to show on the screen for the user. U stands for updating the data like when you need to change the price of a product in your database or when you need to add a comment to a post. You're updating the data. D stands for deleting data. This is straight-forward because it's just removing the data from the database. At a higher level, CRUD apps consist of three major parts: the database , UI ( user interface )/front-end, and the server( API )/back-end. What is a Database Almost everything we do on the internet, from the pictures we view, blogs and all the Wikipedia pages we read, all store their information somewhere. These bits of information have to be stored somewhere, that's where databases come into play. A Database helps us store and organize our data, enabling us to easily read, create, update, and delete that data. The database is where our Data will be stored. A DBMS/ Database Management System is a service in which we use to create and manage our database. We will be using Firebase's Firestore as our DBMS , but there are also several other services in which we can host our Database . There are also several types of Database Management Systems that can be categorized in the way in which they store data. The more popular types include Relational Databases (SQL) and Document Stores (NoSQL) . As you may have already guessed, Firestore is a NoSQL DBMS which means it isn't relational like SQL but instead is a collection of documents. We will spare you the details about every database service available, but if you are interested in learning more, check out this intro to databases and styles guide . The UI / User Interface The UI or user-interface will include everything we have learned about building applications in React so far as a way for users to interact with our database. Let's say, for example, we have an app that stores a collection of a users favorite games or books. When that user signs up, we want our App to direct the user to their Dashboard and maybe render that specific user's current list of favorite games. The user themselves aren't making the request, that request is programmed to happen when that user signs-in. When it comes to creating or updating data, the user will usually interact with a form ( onSubmit ) and buttons ( onClick ) that interact with the database based on those events. We will program or application to handle these events and make them interact with our DB accordingly. We can also provide a search bar for the user to make special queries to our database that filters specific data the user is looking for. We will learn more about how to do that with Firestore as we progress through the course. The Server or API APIs are how most developers create full-stack web applications. Usually, this is an application separate from our client-side which allows us to make special HTTP requests to our database, also known as a server-side application . These special requests are handled by something known as routes , and they will be responsible for what actions need to be performed when called. For instance, a GET request gets, or reads, data; while a POST requests posts, or creates data. These two requests would be handled by two different routes, aka Request Handlers . These route functions may vary depending on the needs of the app, but they are usually designed to carry out the four basic CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete. Web applications that separate client and server side are considered REST APIs , \" RE presentational S tate T ransfer \". We do not need to go deep into details for this, but just know this is a very common practice. While creating server-side apps have become increasingly easier, we will not need to create a separate server since Firebase provides us with a database(store) and a server with authentication. We'll be using the Firestores Software Development Kit / SDK to build the server, combined with Firestore Security Rules for authorization and Firebase Auth services to authenticate users.

Why Use Data Modeling? Data modeling is the process of creating a model that represents the relationships between the different types of data in your database. Even though NoSql is a non-relational database we may sometimes have data that is related. NoSql databases are capable of relational data but, it is not a requirement like it is with SQL databases. A data model emphasizes what data is needed and how it should be organized in a visual manner. In a nutshell, we want to make sure all ( or most ) of our data objects are accurately represented well before we write any code or build a database! ( This will save some headaches down the road. ) One of the most common ways to do this is with the use of an Entity Relationship Diagram , or ERD . Reason to build and use an ERD: Using data models are much easier than changing your real database. Planning ahead will help keep your new database from becoming disorganized, or incorrect. When creating a database it's easier for you to review a data model than review a a database design. In most cases it is harder to describe a database to your someone than simply showing them a model that represents the database. These data models help improve organization and communication within your team. The Setup We are going to go through the process of creating a data model(ERD) for a Restaurant Ordering App . First you need to go to Draw.io . Select where you want to save it: GitGub repository, your local hard drive, or any of the others. Select \"Decide Later\" if you just want to dive right in. On the left hand side scroll the menu down to Find the \"Entity Relation\" tab. UML Notation Before continuing know that: NOTE: Entity Relationship Diagrams are written in UML Notation to visualize the relationships between tables. UML stands for Unified Modeling Language and it is basically the go-to for designing object-oriented systems. The Process We will think about our data needs step by step. The first functionality we want is for a user to be able to search restaurants and click a button to look at the menu of the restaurant the selected. We will start with a data model that represents a restaurant and keep it in a collection called \"restaurant\" collection. Follow along and do the same as the image below and Model the data for our \"restaurant\" collection Draw.io for our ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram). Select the icon labeled \"list\" under \"Entity Relation\". We will represent a \"restaurant\" collection with several fields a user would expect when searching for a restaurant with their appropriate data types that will correspond with the FireStore database. Now think about this from the user's perspective. You only want to send the data that is immediately relevant. Sending extra data can be slow and costly. What data is unneeded for the initial search and would take up to much space? Look at the data in the picture that you put in your ER diagram . Which one of the 4 pieces of data (Name, Rating, Tags, Menu) should be separated out from the search? Reason for Separation Receiving the menu data at this point is unneeded since we want the user to click on a button for the menu and at that point we could query the menu items from the database. Put Data in a Sub Collection It is not always the right way; there are pros and cons, but in general each potential separate user action with our data should be in its own collection. Searching for restaurants and pressing a button to look at the menu are two separate actions and putting the \"Menu Item\" data in a sub-collection of \"Restaurant\" makes the most sense for this use case. When a user clicks the button on the chosen restaurant we can easily return just the restaurant's corresponding \"Menu Items\" since we already have the reference and id to the document in \"Restaurant\" collection. This saves us from having to return every menu item from every restaurant returned from a search result. (That would be a lot of data...!) Here is how we would model it in our ER Diagram. Follow along and make your diagram look the same. Notice We have the label \"Restaurants/Menu item\" This shows \"Menu Item\" is a sub collection of Restaurants. Notice that there are several relationship lines to pick from: One-to-One , One-to-Many ect... Zoom in on the picture with your browser Ctrl + + if you're unable to see them clearly. Also, notice the added id field. Remember each document put in the collection will have a corresponding id that can be setup to be added automatically when FireStore adds a new document. In addition, it is important to note that The id field in FireStore is also a String. Cardinality The relationship lines correspond with cardinality . Cardinality refers to the direction that describes the types of relationships that we maintain between our entities. These types of relationships are how we can enforce data integrity throughout our database. For example, each restaurant has many \"menu items\"(a One-to-Many relationship). NOTE: Look at the line connecting \"Restaurant\" and \"Menu Items\". Trace it from \"Restaurant\" to \"Menu Item and you'll find a single hash line followed by three splayed lined that look like a turkey foot print. This says, \"one-to-many\". Reverse the direction you traced the line and you'll find the turkey foot print then the single hash line. This says, \"many-to-one\". But what cardinality is really talking about is the maximum or minimum number of relationships that can be maintained between two entities. For example, a user can have multiple userContacts but only one usersAddress . Relationships Explained One-to-One : This relationship can be summed up as one table to another table allowing only one connection each. Such as a User table having a One-to-One relationship for a drivers license table. The user can only have one drivers license so it would be applicable to use the One-to-One relationship. One-to-Many : An example of a One-to-Many relationship would be a Users table and an Orders table. The User can have as many Orders as they want but each Order could only have one User; using a One-to-Many relationship would work perfectly. Many-to-One : this can be understood as the opposite of the previous. Many-to-Many : An example of this would be if the restaurant wanted to allow table reservations where each table could have many bookings throughout the night and each time slot could have many tables reserved. To practice this Cardinal Lines, find the elements you need under the \"Entity Relation\" tab on the left toolbar and place them between the two collections. When a user orders they are going to pick one restaurant to order from on a per transaction basis. So add a user to the data. The user has a One-to-One relationship with a restaurant. Below Under \"User\" collection the Contact data is The map data type. It is found in FireStore and is what we would call an object in JavaScript. And we would expect to find a object with {state, city, address} ect... You will find it under the \"UML\" menu tab labeled \"object\" We have now modeled our data based for our user interactions. Restaurants will be returned from a search query. When a user clicks a restaurants menu button the corresponding \"menu item\" sub-collection will be returned. When a user selects a restaurant to order from the restaurant's ID will correspond One-to-One with a user and be saved in the restaurantId field of the \"User\". When building your Capstone App or any other in the future, use this tool to help you organize your thoughts and communicated not only to other people but to yourself ! Determining Our Data Model Most of the information above assumes you already have a working database, or at least a couple tables. We've talked about how to read/interpret our diagrams and in our next class assignment we will work on creating an ER diagram, but let's take a second to talk about modeling the data that these diagrams come from. NOTE: data modeling is a broad subject. We will discuss only what's most important for us at this level. Let's now assume that we are starting completely from scratch. We do not have a database set up at this point but we know we are going to use NoSQL . We will want to take the following actions: Understand the company's/app's industry We need to know what we are building. Having an understanding of our business model will help us determine what our entities will be. Identify our entities What collections do we think we will need to create? If I am in the eCommerce space I will probably want a collection called customers , another called products ... and so forth. Identify our attributes Now that we have our tables it's time to determine what fields should exist on those tables. Every \"customer\" should definitely have an id , but what else? We might want to know the customers' first and last names and probably some contact information: phone , address , email ...etc. Identify our relationships We have a \"customers\" table and because we know that customers will place orders, we've also gone ahead and created an orders collection. Each table has its own set of attributes but how are they related? What's the cardinality? Well . . . if we assume that any customer can have multiple orders (that would make sense, right?) then we know that we have established a \"one-to-many\" relationship. This is the thought process you will go through as you develop NoSQL databases on your own. It may seem simple or it may seem complicated but data modeling is an important part of the development process and a good skill to have. Always begin by drawing it out on paper so you have a good visual understand2 Model Data with a Schema Schemas are objects that define the structure of the data. We use it in our code to determine how our data is laid out before we enter it into the database. Previously we simply used Object-Literals {} . The disadvantage of this is we have to keep checking back to all the places we have modified the object before inserted it into its collection. With a schema we can setup a standard process for how all data is structured including safeguards like default values before it gets stored in the DB. We can do this by using JS Classes to construct objects that will then be put into our database. The class would Represent how a piece of data wold look in the collection. Below is an example of a \"User\" schema. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 // Models/schema.js class User { constructor ( name , restaurantId , city , state , address ) { this . name = name || \"\" ; // if name is undefined, default as empty string this . restaurantId = restaurantId || \"0\" ; // default value \"0\" this . contact = getContact ( city , state , address ) // creates a \"get\" method // Sets default values if none are provided function getContact ( city = \"\" , state = \"\" , address = \"\" ) { return { city , state , address } } } } const userOne = new User ( 'Ted' , 78 , 'Lake Stevens' , 'WA' ); console . log ( userOne ); // will return { name:'Ted',restaurantId: 78, // contact: {city:'Lake Stevens', state:'WA', address: \"\" } // } const userTwo = new User ( 'Max' , null , 'Denver' , 'CO' , '14221 sun set' ); console . log ( userTwo ); // will return { name:'Max',restaurantId: 0, // contact: {city:'Denver', state:'CO', address: '14221 sun set' } // } // add in FireBase FireStore database await addDoc ( userCollectionRef , userOne ) You've seen this in JS211. A Class is a function that constructs an object of same properties (congruent shape) with different values. It does this with the constructor() method that requires this information be passed into the Class before the object can be generated. Practice It Prompt 1 : You will practice by going back to your FireBase assignments project and changing one of or more of the object literals {} you put in the database with a schema. Go to one of the previous 1-4 day assignments(FakeCars) and create a Models/schema.js folder and file. Inside of the schema file, create a Class that follows your car data collection. export default the Class. Then import and call that Class in the form component to create a new car. Replace your Object-Literal with this imported Class before inputting the data like above, Prompt 2: Right now in our Restaurant example we are only saving the restaurantId when a user picks a restaurant to order from but we are not saving the chosen menu items. You have two choices: make another map object to save the item choices in the \"User\" collection or make a new \"transaction\" sub-collection of \"User\" to save all transaction data and chosen menu items. In your ERD, do one of them and prepare to explain why you did one over the other in class tomorrow.

Below is an example of a \"User\" schema. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 // Models/schema.js class User { constructor ( name , restaurantId , city , state , address ) { this . name = name || \"\" ; // if name is undefined, default as empty string this . restaurantId = restaurantId || \"0\" ; // default value \"0\" this . contact = getContact ( city , state , address ) // creates a \"get\" method // Sets default values if none are provided function getContact ( city = \"\" , state = \"\" , address = \"\" ) { return { city , state , address } } } } const userOne = new User ( 'Ted' , 78 , 'Lake Stevens' , 'WA' ); console . log ( userOne ); // will return { name:'Ted',restaurantId: 78, // contact: {city:'Lake Stevens', state:'WA', address: \"\" } // } const userTwo = new User ( 'Max' , null , 'Denver' , 'CO' , '14221 sun set' ); console . log ( userTwo ); // will return { name:'Max',restaurantId: 0, // contact: {city:'Denver', state:'CO', address: '14221 sun set' } // } // add in FireBase FireStore database await addDoc ( userCollectionRef , userOne ) You've seen this in JS211. A Class is a function that constructs an object of same properties (congruent shape) with different values. It does this with the constructor() method that requires this information be passed into the Class before the object can be generated.","title":"Model Data with a Schema"},{"location":"module-3/dataOrganization/#practice-it","text":"Prompt 1 : You will practice by going back to your FireBase assignments project and changing one of or more of the object literals {} you put in the database with a schema.

It helps provide a layer of persistence to our applications. That means, even if our application breaks or is shut down, we can still access the data next time the app starts up; and all devices (clients) accessing the database should see the exact same data. Since we've been working with Firebase to implement our Authentication and server needs, let's use another one of their services called Firestore to manage our dataset. Firebase also has a console that will allow us to visualize the data and query it. This becomes very useful for planning, organizing and debugging our data. There are different types of Database Management Systems available to us but in this course we will use what is called a, NoSQL database. The Cloud Side-note, while working with Firebase, Google Drive, OneDrive, or Dropbox we're working in what we collectively call \"The Cloud\u201d. It is here we should demystify this term. \"The Cloud\u201d is just a collection of servers(computers without screens, mice or keyboards) that store your data. The pictures below are examples of server farms, aka \"The Cloud\". The Cloud 1 The Cloud 2 The Cloud 3 NoSQL vs SQL? When developers say \u201cNoSQL database,\u201d they are usually referring to any non-relational database : like MariaDB, MongoDB, etc. SQL - Structure Query Language Relational Databases like SQL , are highly structured in the way their data is entered. Instead of having objects that represent bits of data like noSQL databases, SQL databases have entities , and each entity has fields that describe that entity. You can think of a spreadsheet table to visualize this. Below we see columns: id , email , age , name , password . Each of these are the \"fields\" of the entity. They describe the data collection. The rows of this column are the entries . There are three rows in this table, thus there are three entries in the database. The table describes a single entity. id email age name password 001 bob@email.com 55 Bob B wonderful55 002 sarah@email.com 75 Sarah F turtleLove1955 003 emily@email.com 25 Emily T rainbowHearts33 Additionally, we call entities in SQL tables . Tables describe types of data like Users, Products, Addresses, and Companies, etc. Tables help us compartmentalize and organize data but can be linked to one another so they have a relationship, i.e. a relational database. For instance, addresses have similar properties like street number, street, city, state and zip. But our Customers and our Employees and our Companies could all share the same Addresses at some point. So, we keep our Addresses stored in one table and our Customers in another, our Employees in another table and our Companies in another but we relate them to the individual Addresses as needed. This way we don't duplicate data or need to pull out more data than we need for every call to the server. There are some upsides to this way of organizing data but there are some downsides, one of them is the steep learning curve. It can be daunting to plan out the structure of a relational database without prior experience. So let us begin with a NoSQL solution first. NoSQL NoSQL is more open ended and can be structured with no regard to the relationships of the data. NoSQL is made up of collections of documents . These documents represent what you know as Objects and they function exactly the same way as objects you've been using so far. Like the \"entries\" in SQL, these documents represent each object of data in the database. Instead of having columns/fields, each document has properties (just like JavaScript Objects). And again, we call them key-value pairs. The collection , we mentioned is just a simple Array. (The SQL equivalent would be an \"entity\" or \"table\"). Look below at the NoSQL Cars Collection. This is an Array of two Objects, aka a collection of two documents. In this way we can think of our \"tables\" as collections; just a way to collect related data. NoSQL Cars Collection 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 [{ \"_id\" : ObjectId ( \"600c626932e0e6419cee81a7\" ), \"year\" : 2017 , \"make\" : \"hyundai\" , \"color\" : \"white\" , \"km\" : 22000 , \"price\" : 32000 }, { \"_id\" : ObjectId ( \"45c626932e0e6419cee8gfg0\" ), \"year\" : 2010 , \"make\" : \"ford\" , \"color\" : \"red\" , \"km\" : 29000 , \"price\" : 42000 }] When we read data from this type of database we will get back a collection /Array documents /Objects. You'll find the methods you learned in JS211( .push() . splice() , .map() ect\u2026), will come in-handy when accessing this data. You might be wondering how we would keep our data organized and structured like a SQL database if there is now way to enforce how Objects/Documents are created in a NoSQL database, and you would be right to think this. We don't want our database to have lots of similar documents without predictable \"shape\", i.e. same property names and same data types in each value. This would make for a very unpredictable application. To solve this we'll introduce schemas which are like templates for how each document should be created. We'll definitely learn more about this later but for now you can visualize a possible schema for the dataset above with the example below: Document Schema Example 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 { \"_id\" : required unique Integer , \"year\" : required Integer , \"make\" : required Text string , \"color\" : required Text string , \"km\" : required Integer , \"price\" : required Integer } Above you see that each property requires a value to be entered and each value has a data type it has to match. When then is enforced it will give the user an error telling them the document didn't get stored to the database. More on this later. Let's now figure out how to enter and retrieve data from the database(DB). Read & Write to the DB READ A read operation means we are fetching or reading some data from the database. You can think of this like the GET requests we learned about previously. In our NoSQL solution with Firebase, this manifests itself in the form of functions like getDocs and collection from FireBase . Example of fetching data from a DB in App.js 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 import { db } from './firebase-config' // first import the functions import { collection , getDocs } from '@firebase/firestore' // Then use the `collection` to specify and store a reference to the data // you want const carsCollection = collection ( db , 'cars' ); // The following would be inside an await function to your async // function(`useCallback()`) // Use the `getDocs` function to retrieve data, pass in the `carsCollection` // variable to tell it what DB and what collection to retrieve. const data = await getDocs ( carsCollection ); NOTE: this code snippet is not functional by itself. You will need to add this to the rest of your component. WRITE A write operation is something that c reates, u pdates or d eletes data. These could correspond to our POST, PUT and DELETE methods. The FireBase functions that represent these actions are: addDoc() , updateDoc() , deleteDoc() . Example of adding data to a DB inApp.js 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 import { db } from './firebase-config' // first import the functions import { collection , addDoc } from '@firebase/firestore' // Then use the `collection` to specify and store a reference to the data // you want const carsCollection = collection ( db , 'cars' ); // Use a new object to build the document to be stored const newCar = { year : 2017 , price : 3200 , make : \"Hyundai\" , model : \"Tucson\" , color : \"white\" , km : 10560 }; // The following would be inside an await function to your async // function(`useCallback()`) // use the `addDoc` function send the new object to be stored as a // document in the cars collection await addDoc ( carsCollection , newCar ); NOTE: this code snippet is not functional by itself. You will need to add this to the rest of your component. If you look at your Firebase console you'll see a new document has been stored in the \"cars\" collection as a document in the Firestore database. Additional Resources How do NoSQl databases work?

In order for us to interact with a Database, we first need to create it. We will first create our Firestore DB on the Firebase console, where we will check out some of the Data Types available and how data is stored. After we create our Firestore DB, we then want build a CRUD web application to interact with Firestore through a UI . People who use our web application shouldn't be creating data on your Firestore console, instead, we will build out the services for them to interact with. This is what a CRUD application is, after all. We will cover these CRUD operations in detail soon enough, for now, let's get familiar with the Firestore console. Let's begin by creating the Firestore instance. We should already have a project created on Firebase from our Authentication with Firebase lesson , so let's continue to work on that same project. Create Your First Collection INSTRUCTIONS : Navigate to your current project on Firebase and follow the instructions below to get started on creating your first Firestore Database instance. 1. Create the Database On the Firebase Dashboard , click on Firestore tab listed in the column on the left. Next, click on the \"Create database\" button. A modal should have popped asking you to set some rules. Check next screenshot... 2. Enabling Test Mode We will be selecting test mode to continue building our app while in development. NOTE: It is important to make sure to change this before taking our app into production. We will talk about setting rules later in this course before we host our application on a live server. Test mode is strictly for development. Click \" next \" to proceed and go to the next screenshot. 3. Set Location Now, we need to set our location in which our database will be stored. Choose the appropriate location that will best serve for our intended audience. NOTE: If you are in the US, you would choose US. Click \" next \" to proceed and it should take you to the Firestore Dashboard. Proceed to the next screenshot. 4. Firestore Dashboard Now that we are on the Dashboard screen, we have successfully created our DB instance. Now we need to give it some data by creating our first collection . Think of a collection as a organized set of data where every document listed under these collections are created with a Unique Identifier , a \"UID\" . Click on \" Start Collection \" Proceed to the next screenshot. 5. First Collection These collections can be specific to the type of data you are trying to store. If you are trying to store more info about a User , you would create a collection called users that would have a document for every user that signs up for your service. If you wanted to store a collection of books , the collection could be called books . In this example, I will be creating data that represents a list of video games. Give your new collection a name, this can be anything you want for demonstration purpose, or something that you have in mind for your Capstone Project. Click \"next\" and proceed to the next screenshot. 6. First Document We should now be prompted to provide our new collection our first document . Every document will have a unique identifier and the data we store inside it will be similar to that of a javascript object, key-value pairs , where an object key would represent the field . These fields will allow for several data types, but for now, we will focus on the basic string and simple timestamp . This example is working with video games, so make sure to make it relevant to your database. Click on \"Auto-ID\" to generate a Unique ID for this document to be referred to as. Every document needs a Unique Identifier and it is always best practice to allow firestore to create the UID for us. Add a field name with the data type of string The first field we want to add can be the name or \"title\" that represents the document. These fields can be named whatever they want, and should be dependent on what your data represents. Add a value to your first field. This example will be: title: \"Super Mario Bros\" Add another field by pressing the \"+\" icon. Add another field name with the data type of string , this example will be \" genre \" Add a value to your second field. This example will be: genre: \"Platform\" Add a field name with the data type of timestamp The next field in this example represents the games \" release_date \" and the value will be of type \"timestamp\" . Choose \" timestamp \" as the data type. Select an appropriate time in relation to your data, this example is relevant to the game. NOTE: Leaving the time blank will default to 12:00:00am. When using Firestore's \"timestamp\" , it is important to note that the data will be stored in a unique way which we will need to later modify to make it more readable to the human eye. Proceed to the next screenshot. 7. First Document - Continued Let's add some more fields and try out some other data types available for us to store. In this example, we will be talking about the \"array\" and \"map\" data types in Firestore. The array type is exactly like the arrays we are already familiar with. You can list multiple values inside an array. This example will be listing a simple array with the field name \" protagonists \" for this game. The map is harder to understand, but think of it as a sub-collection inside our document. It is similar to an object with nested key-value pairs inside of it. If it doesn't make sense now, that's ok. This section serves as only an introduction to the capabilities of Firestore, and it will become clearer as we continue to build our database. Add a field name with the data type of map , this example will be characters Inside our new sub-collection inside our characters map , add another field name with the data type of array . This example, we will start with a protagonist sub-collection. Add as many values with the data type of string to create a simple array of string values. This example will list 3 different characters. So far, if we read our data in JavaScript, Firebase would compile our document to look like this object: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 { title : Super Mario Bros , release_date : { // This is how Firebase will translate the timestamps seconds : 12310564564 , nanoseconds : 456423123441 } // This is the map of characters with and array or protagonists characters : { protagonists : [ \"Mario\" , \"Luigi\" , \"Toadstool\" ] } } As we can see, a map sort of looks like a key-value pair whose value is another object. Let's look at another example. Proceed to the next screenshot. 8. First Document - Continued-2 Our data can be as simple or as complicated as we want. Depends on the needs of your application. We will show one last example of what nested data would look like inside firebase. We will again be working with our character's map , but now we are going to further nest another map / sub-collection inside our characters sub-collection. We will build two more arrays, one list with a field name \" bosses \" and another with field name \" enemies \" Inside the \" characters \" or similar field you may have created, add two more field. Name the first field. In this example it will be \"bosses\". Give this array some values. Name the second field. In this example it will be \"enemies\". Give this array some values. If we saw our data compiled to javascript, our characters example would look like this at this point: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 { // ... previous data characters : { protagonists : [ \"Mario\" , \"Luigi\" , \"Toadstool\" ], antagonists : { bosses : [ \"King Koopa\" ], enemies : [ \"Koopa Troopa\" , \"Hammer Bro\" , \"Goomba\" ] } } Not too bad, we just created our first document! Finally, save your data Proceed to next screenshot. 9. Results Great job! If you are seeing this page, you should seeing see your own data listed in your collection. Feel free to add more documents and/or collections as your desire. This data will initialize our data with some dummy data to play around with as we move on into explaining CRUD operations in the next section. Data Types There are several Data Types available to store in Firestore, which makes writing documents a breeze. Some of these data types should be familiar to us, such as: Boolean, Arrays, Text String and Integers. While we will more than likely use some data types more than others, it's good to know what is available to us in case we need to utilize it in the future. Let's break down some of these Data Types available to us: Data Type Sort Order Notes Text string UTF-8 encoded byte order This data type will be the most commonly used ones, especially as we first begin to understand Firestore. Just like a text string you are familiar with. Integer Numeric You can store plain numbers, no strings attached. Keep in mind, javascript will always return numeric values as a string so you will still need to convert it to a number if that's your thing. Array By element values You should be comfortable with Arrays by now, and this is a great way to store data. It may take some extra work to change data in an array, but luckily for us, we are familiar with array methods and HOF's. Within an array, elements maintain the position assigned to them. You cannot store another Array inside an Array as an element. Boolean false<true It's either going to be true... or false Date and Time Chronological Firestore has it's own way of storing Timestamps. It stores time in an object with two key/value pairs: seconds and nanoseconds. \"It is encoded using the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar which extends the Gregorian calendar backwards to year one\" Null --- It is possible to store a value as null. Not much more to say about that. Map By keys, then by value Maps represent javascript objects. This is useful when you want to store nested data in your document. Geographical point By latitude, then longitude At this time we do not recommend using this data type due to querying limitations. It is generally better to store latitude and longitude as separate numeric fields. If your app needs simple distance-based geoqueries, see Geo queries Keep these Data Types in mind when it comes to thinking about your Capstone Project. How are you going to want to store data into a document? What data types are you more than likely going to use? Get familiar with these Data Types and think about what collections you will need and what kind of data are you storing in your documents . Firestore Web SDKs Working on the Firestore console is convenient, especially useful for Database Management and Admins, but this is not how we intend for others to interact with Firestore. We need to build a User Interface using Node.js and we are going to build it on the React JavasScript library we all have gotten to know and love. So where do we start, and what is an SDK? SDK - Software Development Kit SDK is an acronym for Software Development Kit , also known as devkit for short. An SDK is a set of tools and programs that are available to developers, like you, to create applications for specific platforms. SDK s are designed by the platforms they are meant for, we are using the Firebase SDK available for the Cloud Firestore API. The Firebase JavaScript SDK implements the client-side libraries used by applications using Firebase services. We have access to this by running npm install firebase in any of our projects and setting up our \"firebase-config\" file. \"firebase-config\" file We are already familiar with the Auth library as we have used it in the previous sections. Just like we reached out and initialized \"Auth\" into our project, we will do the same for our Firestore Database/DB Lets take a look at that config file one more time, but this time with Firestore . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 // Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need import { initializeApp } from \"firebase/app\" ; import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth' // Let's bring in the `getFirestore` function from \"firebase/firestore\" import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore' const firebaseConfig = { apiKey : process . env . REACT_APP_FIREBASE_KEY , authDomain : process . env . REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DOMAIN , projectId : process . env . REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID , storageBucket : process . env . REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET , messagingSenderId : process . env . REACT_APP_FIREBASE_SENDER_ID , appId : process . env . REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID , measurementId : process . env . REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID }; const app = initializeApp ( firebaseConfig ); export const auth = getAuth ( app ); // Initialize Cloud Firestore and export the reference to the service. export const db = getFirestore ( app ) import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore' export const db = getFirestore(app) That's all there is to it. We now have access to our Firestore DB and can make queries to the DB and set up our CRUD operations using the Firestore SDK. Keep in mind, just like we exported the \"Auth\" reference when and used it when making queries to our Auth instance, we want to do the same when we try to query Firestore. We will need to import {db} from \"./firebase-config\" in the files where we are needing it. The db reference will always be the first argument for any of the functions we use from the \"firebase/firestore\" library. 1 2 3 4 5 6 // This is an example of *Updating* a doc. It uses the \"setDoc\" function // from the Firestore SDK library. // This function takes in 3 arguments: Our \"db\" instance, the \"collection\" // we want to reference, and the \"document\" in the collection to reference // We ALWAYS pass our \"db\" instance first. await setDoc ( db , \"video_games\" , \"CVX4ZV5FG5SADF54\" ) Summary Awesome! So we now have a working DBMS , we created our first collection, and we even added our first document. Although we just created some data, we are going to further explain the four CRUD operations using the Firestore SDK instead of writing it ourselves on the Firestore Dashboard. Remember, this database is meant to store user inputs, dependent on the apps needs, of course. Our next step is to build a UI using the 4 basic operations we discussed earlier: Create , Read , Update , and Delete . Additional Resources Blog, Lionel Valdellon - What is an SDK?

Then we learned how to the data in in this global state to each component by wrapping them with another component/function with mapStateToProps . This process keeps all components in the app in sync with the same set of data so there is no confusion. But now, we wonder how me might change the global state from a local component. How does a component get access to update a global state? The solution is a function called: mapDispatchToProps . Notice the similarity to mapStateToProps ? Overview We're continuing our learning of Redux because it's a great way to make sure all of our components share the same state. Remember, Redux doesn't actually do anything visually for the user of the application. This is all for the developer right now. Redux is strictly for data management. It will eventually allow you to do cool things like update charts instantaneously when data changes. Remember in your music controller app? If your volume component changed the global state of your app you might be able to create another component at the bottom of the dashboard that represented the amount of volume the user selected in a graph. If you're controlling data with Redux you can keep that data in one place but trigger the alert to your user that \"loud volume may cause hearing loss\" while also updating the chart to represent the level they chose. Again, Redux is a data management system for us developers to do cool things across the application using one source of truth. So any direct benefit to the user comes with the fact that Redux allows us to develop more complex applications. Also, keep this in mind . . . Redux is not completely replacing local state . If you want a component to be able to toggle between two states, for example on/off, you can still use: 1 2 3 4 5 state = { on : true } // ...more code...this.setState({ on: !this.state.on }) In the above code, this component, and only this component, will have access to this.state.on . Redux is for when you want to share a central state data across multiple components. It's important that we are clear on the difference there. See It - ActionCreators & mapDispatchToProps Actions The first thing we need to build so our components can update/mutate state is create something called Redux Actions . Actions are simply JavaScript Objects. They typically have two properties (although you may see others), a type and a value . They look like this: A Redux Action 1 2 3 4 const addCar = { type : 'ADD_CAR' , value : 'Tesla Model Y' } Spelling the value of type in capital letters, like 'ADD_CAR' is a Redux convention. It lets other developers on your application know that you are using Redux. The value of value is whatever you want to update your state with. NOTE: Another common practice is to use the key name payload instead of value for the simple verbalization trickery. \"What is the value of payload ?\" is easier to say than \"What is the value of value ?\" Nevertheless, we'll use value for this lesson... Furthermore, it has become less common to use plain actions (seen above, a simple JS Object). Instead, we build Action Creators . Action creators are simply functions that return an action. That means, its just a JS Function that returns and JS Object. So instead of the syntax above, we change it to: Action Creator function 1 2 3 4 5 6 const addCar = ( newCar ) => { return { type : 'ADD_CAR' , value : newCar } } As you can see, it's just a function that returns an object. But why? Well. . . take a look at the action creator above and notice that it has an argument, newCar . With action creators we can pass options to our action creating functions and have them return different things each time they're called. This is more powerful than plain action objects because it can dynamically respond to user's input. We will be using Action Creators going forward. Finally, the last thing you need to know about actions is that they correspond to a certain piece of the global state. Only you, the developer, get to decide what corresponds to what. So for example, we have an action called ADD_CAR above. It makes sense that we would use this action to update the cars property in state. Remember this example from our last pre-work: Global State - redux/state.js 1 2 3 4 export default { user : null , cars : [ '1' , '2' , '3' , '4' ] } We want to make actions that make sense for our data model. Since cars is an array, two common operations would be add to and remove a car from the array. So cars might have the following actions: ADD_CAR - push a new car value on to the array. REMOVE_CAR - delete a particular car from the array. Likewise for the user property. It's null right now but it could probably represent an Object or maybe just a plain String. Either way, actions that make sense for this property would be: SET_USER - set which user is signed in right now. UNSET_USER - remove the user at sign-out. Again, the CAPITALIZED_UNDERSCORE naming convention is a Redux convention. You get to name these as you like, so make sure they make sense to you and other developers. Remember, code is NOT what a computer reads. Code is what humans read. Final note about action creators: they all go in a single file called redux/actions.js (inside of the \"redux\" folder) like below. redux/actions.js File 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 export const addCar = ( newCar ) => { return { type : 'ADD_CAR' , value : newCar } } export const removeCar = ( index ) => { return { type : 'REMOVE_CAR' , value : index } } export const setUser = ( newUser ) => { return { type : 'SET_USER' , value : newUser } } export const unsetUser = ( index ) => { return { type : 'UNSET_USER' , value : index } } The next step is to update our Reducer functions to accept and respond to these incoming Action Objects.","title":"Redux Actions"},{"location":"module-3/redux-actions/#redux-actions","text":"All you need is the plan, the road map, and the courage to press on to your destination.\u2003\u2014Earl Nightingale","title":"Redux Actions"},{"location":"module-3/redux-actions/#review-and-recap","text":"Last week we learned how to use a plain object in a state.js file, functions in a reducer.js file and the Redux tools combineReducers and <Provider /> to create a global state for our application that acts as a central data storage, or a single source of truth , for all of our app's components.

For organizational sake, we'll create a new folder called containers/ to hold these container component. In the cars example, we've been working on, we used a component called Home to list all of our cars. Let's create a new file with the same name ( Home.js ) in our containers folder and connect it to Redux. Redux works by taking the state variables we want and mapping them to props in our component. So if we want to connect Home to the value of cars from our state.js file, the value will be mapped to a prop that we specify (likely as cars ) and then we will access it in the component by calling props.cars . Redux provides a function for doing that called mapStateToProps and we connect it to our component using the connect function. Let's see an example: containers/Home.js File 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 import { connect } from 'react-redux' // import the visual React component \"Home\" import Home from '../components/Home' const mapStateToProps = ( state ) => { return { cars : state . cars } } // wrap the visual React Component \"Home\" with the Redux Container Component Home export default connect ( mapStateToProps )( Home ) We first import the connect function from Redux and our \"dumb\"/visual component . Then we build a mapStateToProps function that builds an object with a key, cars to be set to state.cars . Remember, state.cars is what exists in our state.js file. From there, we can export the Higher-Order Component( HOC ) which will make state.cars (now cars available to our \"dumb\" component, <Home /> as props.cars using the IIFE (Home) .

In our Router.js file where we're used to importing: import Home from '../components/Home' we now import: import Home from '../containers/Home' . This change is how we can start understanding why the term \"dumb component\" was coined. See, a regular React component just returns what it's told to return via its props . But now we're introducing this HOC, which calls the regular React component and provides the props to be rendered. So, in a sort of colloquial jargon, we say a regular React component is a Dumb component and a redux component is a Smart Component/Container . Rude, right? Back in our dumb Home component where we had imported cars.json and did cars.map ... it's now props.cars.map and we no longer need the cars.json file because that data is now in state.js . Additionally, this can now be done on any other component we want and all of them would have access to cars !

But for a more managing an app's global state , that is, a single source of truth our entire app can access, we'll need to create it in another place. Redux happens to be the gold standard for something like this. Here goes!! Redux: the High Overview What is Redux? This is a definition from the Redux website . Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger. You can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library. It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), but has a large ecosystem of addons available. Let's talk about it in more layman's terms and provide some examples. We're used to seeing something like this to build a simple React component that is showing a status (on/off) based on the state: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 import React , { Component } from 'react' class MyComponent extends Component { state = { on : true } render () { return ( < div > < p > The status is : $ { this . state . on ? 'On' : 'Off' } < /p> < /div> ) } } export default MyComponent What if we make a new component called MySecondComponent : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 import React , { Component } from 'react' class MySecondComponent extends Component { render () { return ( < div > < p > This is my second component < /p> < /div> ) } } export default MySecondComponent Does MySecondComponent have access to the state ( on ) of the original MyComponent ? Of course not. Normal React state only works within the component in which it's defined. So MySecondComponent doesn't have any idea what state MyComponent is in unless we pass the state down as props , but as you've probably already seen, passing props down, to only pass more props down becomes tedious, ugly, and unmanageable. Like filling a cup to pour into another cup and then to only pour into yet another cup. But we can change that process with Redux. But first. . . why would we want to do that? Well . . . the previous example might be too specific. MySecondComponent and MyComponent might not need to know about each other or each other's state, but what about if instead of on , MyComponent had the user data for the logged-in user? Then MySecondComponent might want to know about it because it may want to access it at some point in the future. We will eventually handle this by moving the state out of MyComponent and into a global Redux state that both components will have access to. Whenever one component changes the state , i.e. user , the other one will know about it. That's the power of Redux! Before we dive into some examples, let's briefly talk about what Redux is doing and what it isn't doing . What is Redux doing? Redux is helping the DEVELOPER structure the app in a way that makes it simpler for cross-component communication. It helps us limit the passing of props to many different components that need the same information. Simply put, Redux helps define a single source of truth that can be shared with all components simultaneously without passing props. What is Redux NOT doing? Redux is not providing any new styling or logic that the end-user is aware of. The site will look exactly the same. The user will see no difference, but the developer will be able to add advanced functionality more rapidly.

Remember to always include it there. Then the MDTP function returns an object with keys that match the prop names you want to use in the \"dumb\" component. The value of each of these keys will be a function that returns/calls the dispatch function. Since you've already imported the actions you need( { addCar, removeCar } from './actions' ) you can call them inside the dispatch invocation and pass to it the value it will need to carry out it's action ( car or index ). After you add the mapDispatchToProps to the connect() function, your \"dumb\" component will have access to the actions you've already built in actions.js through the prop names: props.addCar and props.removeCar (see below) . When these props are called, your reducers will be called and evaluate which action was created and return the new state back to the \"dumb\" component as props via mapStateToProps .

They can be accessed anywhere in the component by referencing props.cars , props.addCar , or props.removeCar . The way it works: when we pass these functions to the connect function then immediately invoke the Home function we are creating a context around Home that gives it access to the two objects returned from each of the MSTP and MDTP functions.

Again let's look at examples. Reducers as If/Else Statements Before looking at these reducers assume the action creators we defined above are the actions being imported into this reducer file.

It's time to discuss how Redux works and how to set it up for any project. Yes, the setup is a bit tedious but the good thing is you only have to do it once per app. In the video below we breakdown the 4 major steps of setting up global state with Redux. You're asked to create a new repo but creating a new branch on your cars repo will be just fine: Redux: The First Four Steps Create new repo or open your Cars assignment from a last class and create another branch called implement-redux-global-state Install Packages - The first thing we need to do is install two more npm packages into your project. They are redux and react-redux . To do so, run the following command: npm i redux react-redux . Setting Up State, Reducers, Store, And Provider Setup the State Object - Next, we create a redux folder underneath/inside src/ and add a state.js file to it. Inside that file is where we will put the default values for everything we want our entire application to be able to access in one big JavaScript object. We will also make sure it is exported. For example, a state.js file for our cars application will look like this: state.js File 1 2 3 4 export default { user : null , cars : [ '1' , '2' , '3' , '4' ] }; We'll keep it fairly simple for now with just two properties: user and cars . Build a Reducer - A reducer is a function that returns a representation of a specific piece of the state. Think of the reducer functions as a reducing valve . It reduces all of the state object down to smaller, very particular pieces of data so it can be easily consumed in any part of your application. Let's say you have an array of dogs and an array of cats but you only want the dog data in one component and the cat data in another but both data sets in a third component. We can do this easily by building two reducers: one for cats and one for dogs . These functions will REDUCE the state object {dogs : [ ... ], cats: [ ... ]} into two smaller bits of data: dogs: [ ... ] & cats: [ ... ] . See, the reducer functions reduces the larger state object into smaller much easier to use sets of data. To start, we need to create a reducers.js file underneath/inside the redux folder to tell Redux what state to send back to the application. This file will contain a function for each of the keys/value pairs of your state. If our state has two properties, user and cars we need two functions called user and cars that each take a default parameter named state = [] or state = null . We use a default parameter because reducers must never return undefined . For now, the functions will only return state , we'll change this tomorrow when we added actions to change state . Until then.... ...let's bring-in/import another function from Redux called, combineReducer , that, as you might expect, combines your reducers into one usable reducer object. NOTE: This by the way is creating an object-thing with keys to methods that are pointing to the value of your reducer functions. ...this is mostly unimportant to remember unless it helps you visualize what's going on here. At the bottom of the file we will export the combined reducers. NOTE: Don't worry too much about this step now. It's necessary for the setup of Redux but we'll talk about it more in the next class because it's used for mutating the global state. In this lesson, we are just learning how to read the global state. Anyway, based on our state.js file our reducers.js file will look like this: reducers.js File 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 import { combineReducers } from 'redux' const user = ( state = null ) => state const cars = ( state = []) => state export default combineReducers ({ user , cars }) Create the Store - The next part is creating the Redux store . The \"store\" is our global application state. We will eventually connect it to the top of our application and that top component, <App/> or <Main /> , and everything underneath it will have access to the \"store\". A \"store\" is created using the state.js file we just created and some additional Redux components. We will create a store.js file underneath/inside in the redux/ folder and it will look like this: store.js File 1 2 3 4 5 import { createStore } from 'redux' import reducers from './reducers' import state from './state' export default createStore ( reducers , state ) Simply put, we use the createStore method from redux to create a store with the given reducers and state . Wrap the Provider around the app - To tie in the store , state , and reducers together with our React app(function) we need to import and use the { Provider } component from 'react-redux' and provide our store in the App.js file. To do all of this, we will then \"wrap\" our application with the Provider component and pass the store as a prop called store . App.js File 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 // import BrowserRouter and Router and Navigation from '../pathnameHere' import { Provider } from 'react-redux' import store from './store' function App () { return ( < Provider store = { store } > < BrowserRouter > < Navigation /> < Router /> < /BrowserRouter> < /Provider> ); } Note the BrowserRouter , Navigation and Router from last week. Setup Complete!!! Ok . . . that sounds like a lot of set up (and it is) but we only have to do this once . Whenever we add new properties to your global state we simply need to put the new key/value in the correct places - which we will practice in the coming homework . For now, it's time to talk about our components being able to read from this global state we've so deftly created.","title":"Redux Setup"},{"location":"module-3/redux-theSetup/#redux-the-set-up","text":"Ok.

Inside that file is where we will put the default values for everything we want our entire application to be able to access in one big JavaScript object. We will also make sure it is exported. For example, a state.js file for our cars application will look like this: state.js File 1 2 3 4 export default { user : null , cars : [ '1' , '2' , '3' , '4' ] }; We'll keep it fairly simple for now with just two properties: user and cars . Build a Reducer - A reducer is a function that returns a representation of a specific piece of the state. Think of the reducer functions as a reducing valve . It reduces all of the state object down to smaller, very particular pieces of data so it can be easily consumed in any part of your application. Let's say you have an array of dogs and an array of cats but you only want the dog data in one component and the cat data in another but both data sets in a third component. We can do this easily by building two reducers: one for cats and one for dogs . These functions will REDUCE the state object {dogs : [ ... ], cats: [ ... ]} into two smaller bits of data: dogs: [ ... ] & cats: [ ... ] . See, the reducer functions reduces the larger state object into smaller much easier to use sets of data. To start, we need to create a reducers.js file underneath/inside the redux folder to tell Redux what state to send back to the application. This file will contain a function for each of the keys/value pairs of your state. If our state has two properties, user and cars we need two functions called user and cars that each take a default parameter named state = [] or state = null . We use a default parameter because reducers must never return undefined . For now, the functions will only return state , we'll change this tomorrow when we added actions to change state . Until then.... ...let's bring-in/import another function from Redux called, combineReducer , that, as you might expect, combines your reducers into one usable reducer object. NOTE: This by the way is creating an object-thing with keys to methods that are pointing to the value of your reducer functions. ...this is mostly unimportant to remember unless it helps you visualize what's going on here. At the bottom of the file we will export the combined reducers. NOTE: Don't worry too much about this step now. It's necessary for the setup of Redux but we'll talk about it more in the next class because it's used for mutating the global state. In this lesson, we are just learning how to read the global state. Anyway, based on our state.js file our reducers.js file will look like this: reducers.js File 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 import { combineReducers } from 'redux' const user = ( state = null ) => state const cars = ( state = []) => state export default combineReducers ({ user , cars }) Create the Store - The next part is creating the Redux store . The \"store\" is our global application state. We will eventually connect it to the top of our application and that top component, <App/> or <Main /> , and everything underneath it will have access to the \"store\". A \"store\" is created using the state.js file we just created and some additional Redux components. We will create a store.js file underneath/inside in the redux/ folder and it will look like this: store.js File 1 2 3 4 5 import { createStore } from 'redux' import reducers from './reducers' import state from './state' export default createStore ( reducers , state ) Simply put, we use the createStore method from redux to create a store with the given reducers and state . Wrap the Provider around the app - To tie in the store , state , and reducers together with our React app(function) we need to import and use the { Provider } component from 'react-redux' and provide our store in the App.js file. To do all of this, we will then \"wrap\" our application with the Provider component and pass the store as a prop called store . App.js File 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 // import BrowserRouter and Router and Navigation from '../pathnameHere' import { Provider } from 'react-redux' import store from './store' function App () { return ( < Provider store = { store } > < BrowserRouter > < Navigation /> < Router /> < /BrowserRouter> < /Provider> ); } Note the BrowserRouter , Navigation and Router from last week. Setup Complete!!! Ok . . . that sounds like a lot of set up (and it is) but we only have to do this once . Whenever we add new properties to your global state we simply need to put the new key/value in the correct places - which we will practice in the coming homework . For now, it's time to talk about our components being able to read from this global state we've so deftly created.","title":"Setting Up State, Reducers, Store, And Provider"},{"location":"module-3/redux-thunk/","text":"Redux Thunk Light tomorrow with today.\u2003\u2014Elizabeth Barrett Browning Review and Recap After last week, you should have a fair grasp over Redux and its few functions that make all the magic of global app state happen. This, of course, allows us to view and mutate a global state from any component we so choose. We've also learned about actions, or action creators, and reducers and how they interact with each other. Our action creators so far have been fairly simple, but what if they need to be more complex in that they could make a fetch to a remote api, wait for the response, set the state to fetching: true while doing it, then set the state to fetching: false, success: true and set the state with the data it returned? In other words, what if they needed to be asynchronous? Enter Redux Thunk. Overview Why are we using Thunk? As we mentioned briefly above, our action creators currently don't support asynchronous actions (they can make a request to an API, wait for a response, then do things during and after the response does come in). What's asynchronous mean again? It means a function that doesn't have a determinate and sequential runtime. It may go out and call an API or make a connection with a database and while those functions are waiting to resolve it can move ahead and load up the screen with other functionality. These types of functions need to be handled differently from normal functions in JavaScript and so far haven't built an action creator that can handle these callbacks or promises (Remember, we've used these fetch and axios in 211 to do async calls). We are going to do the same thing inside our action creators, but in order for Redux to understand these async function we need to add the thunk middleware. What is Thunk? Thunk is middleware that allows action creators to return a Function instead of an Object. What is Middleware? Middleware is a function (or multiple functions) that you want to run every time a certain action happens. We've seen middleware in the last course (JS311) to handle authentication workflows in Express. Thunk works in the same way except that it happens when we call our action creators. Examples Let's get into some examples. First, let's talk about how we set up Thunk. It's incredibly easy. All you do is import thunk from \"redux-thunk\" . Since this is another package you may have also guessed that we need to install \"redux-thunk\" into our application with the following command: npm i redux-thunk. To use redux-thunk we also need to import the applyMiddleware tool from Redux so we can tie the thunk into the createStore function call. All of this happens in the store.js file. Here's what it looks like: redux/store.js 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 // import the `applyMiddlware` tool import { createStore , applyMiddleware } from 'redux' // import the `thunk` tool import thunk from 'redux-thunk' import reducers from './reducers' import state from './state' // pass them as a third argument to the `createStore` call export default createStore ( reducers , state , applyMiddleware ( thunk )) As we can see, there are only three small changes between this store.js file and the one we used last class. They involve the introduction of applyMiddleware , thunk and the application of thunk as the third parameter in createStore() , applyMiddleware(thunk) . Ok that's it, we are set up to use Thunk. So now how do we use it? Well . . . we need create a new property on state, a new action, and a new reducer - just like we're used to! State In the example below we've updated the state for our cars application to include a property called makes to store the available makes of cars. Its default value will be an empty array. It looks like this: makes: [] redux/state.js 1 2 3 4 5 export default { user : null , cars : [ '1' , '2' , '3' , '4' ], makes : [] // <-- Just a place to hold new data } Action The new action creators we add will return a function instead of an object. They will look like this: redux/actions.js 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 // Remember what our previous action creators looked like: export const removeCar = ( index ) => { return { type : 'REMOVE_CAR' , value : index } } // ...more action creators here... export const fetchMakes = () => { return ( dispatch ) => { fetch ( 'https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/vehicles/getallmakes?format=json' ) . then ( res => res . json ()) . then ( response => { const action = { type : 'FETCH_MAKES' , value : response . Results } dispatch ( action ) }) } } with comments 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 // ...more action creators here... export const fetchMakes = () => { // returning a function that has `dispatch` as its only parameter return ( dispatch ) => { // making an asynchronous API call fetch ( 'https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/vehicles/getallmakes?format=json' ) . then ( res => res . json ()) . then ( response => { // create a variable to hold an Object for the results const action = { type : 'FETCH_MAKES' , value : response . Results } // call `dispatch` to send the action Object to the reducer dispatch ( action ) }) } } So what's happening here? We're returning a function that has dispatch as its only parameter. We can write dispatch there because thunk will inject into our action creator automatically. Inside of that function, we are making an asynchronous API call to a government API with fetch . Then we create a variable to hold an Object to store the results of that API call. Lastly, we call dispatch at the end to send our action Object to our reducer. Speaking of . . . let's set that up. Reducer Since we have a new property called makes in our state, we need a new reducer called makes to match. Here's what it looks like: redux/reducers.js 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 const makes = ( state = [], action ) => { switch ( action . type ) { case 'FETCH_MAKES' : return action . value default : return state } } // ... more reducers here ... The Switch/Case statement handles the FETCH_MAKES action that we specified above. Since we know the results of our API is an array, we're able to simply return the action.value (the array of makes in reducers/state.js ). Wrapping Up Now that we've added this action into one of our components using the mapDispatchToProps function like normal, we can call it. When we do, the function will go out and make an API call and then add the results to our global state. The result would look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 makes : [ { Make_ID : 440 , Make_Name : \"Aston Martin\" }, { Make_ID : 441 , Make_Name : \"Tesla\" }, { Make_ID : 442 , Make_Name : \"Jaguar\" }, { Make_ID : 443 , Make_Name : \"Maserati\" }, { Make_ID : 444 , Make_Name : \"Land Rover\" }, { Make_ID : 445 , Make_Name : \"Rolls Royce\" }, { Make_ID : 446 , Make_Name : \"Buell (EBR)\" } // ...etc... ] This is how we would generally start our application if we are fetching data from a database. We would have a state with an empty value and then we would use Redux Thunk to make the call to our database and return the results to it. NOTE: The biggest change here is just getting used to what the new action creator look like. See It - Redux Thunk Practice It Clone the following repo: https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/411_news_articles Call the News API to populate a list of news articles using Redux Thunk Look at the state.js file under the redux folder. You should see just one property called articles with an empty array present. We will populate (or replace) the array with data from the News API. In the reducers.js file you should see the current reducer function for articles . Add a case for FETCH_ARTICLES that simply returns action.value In the store.js file you need to do three things: import applyMiddleware import thunk pass applyMiddleware(thunk) to the createStore function Finally (for the redux/ folder), in actions.js , fill the fetchArticles function so that it calls the API endpoint (with fetch ) and then dispatch es the articleAction action creator. You will need to pass response.articles (the result of the fetch call) to that action creator can fulfill the articles parameter. The API endpoint to call is at the top of the file. Now, in our List container we should see that there is already a mapStateToProps function that is sending in the articles array. We need to make a mapDispatchToProps function that returns a property with key: fetchArticles and value: () => dispatch(fetchArticles()) . Remember to import the fetchArticles action at the top of the page. In the List component we simply need to create a componentDidMount function and call this.props.fetchArticles , which is the redux action we just connected.

Remember how we said a server is the part of the app that reaches into the database to put, change, or get data for the front-end UI to use and display? Alright, most of the time we have to build a server to do this as well as to make security verifications and interface with other servers (APIs/micro-services). Turns out we didn't have to build a server because there are services like FireBase that enable us to create database stores and servers with just some clicks of the mouse. However, there are a few actions we'll need to do now and in the future that require a server/back-end code running to interface with other back-ends. In this lesson we're going to learn how to do this without a server using things called: serverless functions . Serverless refers to functions that run on the back end to help developers build and run applications without having to manage servers. They are no different from the functions you have written in the past. There are still \"servers\" running these serverless functions , but you do not have set them up or manage them. Instead, a cloud provider handles the routine work of provisioning, maintaining, and scaling the server infrastructure. Simply write your code in a designated folder provided by FireBase. You can think of the serverless functions as setting up your own API (like the APIs you used in JS211 to fetch data like beer, Star Wars or Marvel characters) However, instead of using fetch to communicate with the back-end you use FireBase's built in methods. You will be writing serverless functions in node.js so it is considered part of the back-end along with your database. Why Serverless? Security : Every thing is exposed on the front-end client including your code and variables. Having a back-end to handle sensitive operations behind a wall is very important. Versatility : You can have your back-end do something independent of the front-end. Low code setup : FireBase does all the infrastructure and server side code for you. The only thing you need to focus on is the task you are trying to accomplish with the code. API usage : Some API's require back-end code like node.js to utilize them. Having this knowledge in your pocket will be useful as you branch out and build larger projects. Set up Serverless We will walk through the steps to use your first serverless function .

Remember how we said a server is the part of the app that reaches into the database to put, change, or get data for the front-end UI to use and display? Alright, most of the time we have to build a server to do this as well as to make security verifications and interface with other servers (APIs/micro-services). Turns out we didn't have to build a server because there are services like FireBase that enable us to create database stores and servers with just some clicks of the mouse. However, there are a few actions we'll need to do now and in the future that require a server/back-end code running to interface with other back-ends. In this lesson we're going to learn how to do this without a server using things called: serverless functions .

Let's say a user created a book document but misspelled the title. Well, we want the user to be able to edit this error and update the collection . Or maybe the user just wants to delete the book they added as a whole? Well they should be able to delete the data as well. We will begin with delete , as it is a bit simpler, and then move on to update /PUT. D elete To delete a document from our Firestore DB, we need to bring in a couple of functions from the firebase/firestore library. We will be importing { doc, deleteDoc } from \"firebase/firestore\" . Make sure to also import the db instance from our config file. Follow along in the example below. We begin with a higher overview followed by an example for React. Delete a Document - Overview 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 // import our 'db' instance from our 'config' file import { db } from \"../firebase/config\" ; // import doc and deleteDoc from 'firebase/firestore import { doc , deleteDoc } from \"firebase/firestore\" ; // `deleteDoc` will take one parameter, the document reference provided by // `doc`. `doc` will take 3 parameters: our db instance, the collection to // reference, and a Unique Identifier. We will wait for the results. await deleteDoc ( doc ( db , \"books\" , id )); // See next slide to see a more robust example using React... Delete a Document in React 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 import React , { useState } from \"react\" ; import { db } from \"../firebase/config\" ; import { doc , deleteDoc } from \"firebase/firestore\" ; const List = ( props ) => { // Let's assume we already have our data and we are passing it in as // props to our List component and setting our state here. const [ data , setData ] = useState ( props . data ) // We will handle our delete document event in this function, this is // being called by the onClick property on Line 26 const handleDelete = async ( id ) => { // We make a request to Firestore to delete a specific document by id await deleteDoc ( doc ( db , \"books\" , id )); // We also want to update our current state to reflect the changes // we have made. We will use filter here to update our state with the // item instead of making an additional/unnecessary request to Firestore. const newData = data . filter (( item ) => item . id !== id ) // Set the data of our new updated Array and force a re-render. setData ( newData ) }; return ( { /* This is a simple example; style as necessary or implement MUI */ } < div > < ul > { data . map (( item ) => ( < li key = { item . id } > { item . title } < span > { /* This button has our event handler */ } < button onClick = { handleDelete } > X < /button> < /span> < /li> ))} < /ul> < /div> ); } export default List ; There you go, it's that simple! Deleting a specific document is one of the easier operations and does not require much to implement. As long as you update the state properly, your component should reflect that of our database. You can always make another request to the DB to get an updated list, but if we can avoid unnecessary requests, we will always opt for that. Remember, data transfers(requests) costs money. Although we(hopefully), won't make enough requests to go over the the free tier limit in this class, it is always best practice to minimize any extra work our app needs to do because this app could run thousands or millions of times a day with all of our users!! NOTE: There are other ways to delete data from our FireStore DB, make sure you check out the Firebase Documentation about Deleting data if you are interested in deleting a collection or maybe just specific fields in a document. Next, let's turn now to updating data. U pdate We have finally arrived at to U pdating data. By now, we have learned to create, read, and delete data, and hopefully we still have some data to update . To update a document, we need to bring in two functions from the \"firebase/firestore\" library. We need to import doc to create a reference to a specific document by it's ID. To create that reference, we need to provide the doc function our db instance, the collection the document exists in, and the id of the document. It is possible for this ID to come dynamically from maybe react-router-dom , using the useParams or useLocation method, or maybe by passing along props to an Edit.js component, or by many other ways. In these examples, we are going to \"hardcode\" an ID that we know exists in our FireStore DB. If you are following along, make sure to go to your FireStore DB and get an existing ID from one of your books in the book collection to use in the React example below. First, we will begin with a high overview, followed by a somewhat complex React example that includes a getDocs function called inside a useEffect to get us the data we want to edit. We also talk about Timestamp a little more in depth in this section as well as the \"date\" type input. There is a lot going on here, so make sure to go over it slowly. Update a Document - Overview 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 // As always, import the db instance import { db } from \"../firebase/config\" ; //import these functions from `firebase/firestore` library import { doc , updateDoc } from \"firebase/firestore\" ; // Create a reference to the document you want to update. The `doc` function // will take in 3 parameters: the `db` instance, the collection we want to // reference, and the ID of the specific document we want to update. const documentRef = doc ( db , \"books\" , \"UniqueID123\" ); { /* Document ID */ } // We await the results of `updateDoc`. `updateDoc` will take in two // parameters: the document reference and the fields we want to update. await updateDoc ( documentRef , { title : \"Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\" , author : \"J. R. R. Tolkien\" , publish_date : Timestamp . fromDate ( new Date ( \"1954-07-27\" )), characters : [ \"Frodo\" , \"Gandalf\" , \"Smeagol\" ] }) // If you look back at the \"Create\" example, you can see I am updating this // current document with a new title and a new character, while the date // stays the same. // NOTE: FireStore will only update the ffields mentioned in the object and will // not overwrite any existing data that is not mentioned. // Check next slide for an example in React. Note: Although you can update data by specifying fields to update, it is normal convention to include all fields in the document when creating a client-side \"edit\" form. In order to do so, you want to make sure you have the documents current data and lay them out in the input fields provided to the user. By doing this, you are preemptively assuring all data is capable of being edited and returned properly to the DB. Even if the user doesn't specifically edit all of the fields, we will be sure that we will still be getting back the same data along with any new data. Update a Document in React w/Comments This is a bigger example, so try to follow along as best you can. We are going to request some data from our FireStore DB so that we can edit it. To this, we need to have a document and it's id to reference that document. We can do this by copying it from the collection on the FireStore console. For this, we are also going to need to import {getDoc} from \"firebase/firestore\" . getDoc will allow us to get a single document, where getDocs , another method we previously used in the R ead example, will get all the documents in a collection. We are also going to import `{Timestamp} from 'firebase/firestore' as the Timestamp constructor will allow us to format a basic Date string into a FireStore timestamp. We will talk a little more about this timestamp as we go through this example. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 import React , { useEffect , useState } from \"react\" ; // Make sure to include all the imports needed in this component import { doc , updateDoc , getDoc , Timestamp } from \"firebase/firestore\" ; // This is a function in another example we are going to use to format a // date.

Why is this important? Well, when we update a document, we want to provide all current data inside the document. We can fill our inputs to have these values already and the user will simply change what needs to be changed and send the whole document back up to update. If we are working with Timestamps, we have to convert that data to a readable format, and break it down even further to be readable by the date input. The date input will return a string in the format of \"YYYY-MM-DD\". When we get our Timestamp from FireStore, and convert to a string using the \"toDate() function, we get a readable date, but we still need to convert this to an even more readable string and also extract the date specifically. We use a JS method called .toLocaleDateString() to get back the date in string format. Ex. \"2014-06-05\" >> \"6/5/2014\". We will take a quick look at the example we used earlier. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 docResults . data (). publish_date . toDate (). toLocaleDateString () // This returns the string in \"6/5/2014\". Let's break it down. docResults . data (). publish_date // returns {seconds: 1402012800, nanoseconds: 0} (see Timestamp Unix Epoch) docResults . data (). publish_date . toDate () // returns \"Thu Jun 05 2014 19:00:00 GMT-0500 (Central Daylight Time)\" docResults . data (). publish_date . toDate (). toLocaleDateString () // finally we get this result: \"6/5/2014\" You would expect that to be enough, but remember, the date input format is \"2014-06-05\", and yes, even the 0's matter as well as the year placement. Since, \"2014-06-05\" is not the same format as \"6/5/2014\", if we try to provide a value to the date input without formatting it, we get an error saying: 1 The specified value \"6/5/2014\" does not conform to the required format, \"yyyy-mm-dd\" In order for a date input to have a default value, we need to format our string to be the format it expects it to be, which is why we have this helper function. Feel free to use it if you decide Timestamps aren't for you! 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 // dateTypeFormatter const dateTypeFormatter = ( date ) => { let newDate = date . split ( \"/\" ); const year = newDate . pop (); newDate . unshift ( year ); if ( newDate [ 1 ]. length < 2 ) { newDate [ 1 ] = \"0\" + newDate [ 1 ]; } if ( newDate [ 2 ]. length < 2 ) { newDate [ 2 ] = \"0\" + newDate [ 2 ]; } newDate = newDate . join ( \"-\" ); console . log ( newDate ); return newDate ; }; export default dateTypeFormatter // import this function wherever you need to format timestamps, i.e. createCarForm... Now all this can be completely unnecessary and entirely up to you. Of course, at the end of the day, you could always just save the date in a string instead of a Timestamp... but where is the fun in that?

As mentioned before, there are several ways to update data, and though this is just one example, feel free to explore other methods used to update data and make sure to use the methods that best fit your database. At the end of the day, consistency will be a crucial factor in your Firestore DB. Summary Alright! We have covered all four basic operations that make up a CRUD app, that's: C reate, R ead, U pdate, and D elete. These four basic operations will help you create your first Full-Stack application with FireBase.

Deleting a specific document is one of the easier operations and does not require much to implement. As long as you update the state properly, your component should reflect that of our database. You can always make another request to the DB to get an updated list, but if we can avoid unnecessary requests, we will always opt for that. Remember, data transfers(requests) costs money. Although we(hopefully), won't make enough requests to go over the the free tier limit in this class, it is always best practice to minimize any extra work our app needs to do because this app could run thousands or millions of times a day with all of our users!! NOTE: There are other ways to delete data from our FireStore DB, make sure you check out the Firebase Documentation about Deleting data if you are interested in deleting a collection or maybe just specific fields in a document. Next, let's turn now to updating data.","title":"Delete"},{"location":"module-3/ud-firestore/#update","text":"We have finally arrived at to U pdating data. By now, we have learned to create, read, and delete data, and hopefully we still have some data to update . To update a document, we need to bring in two functions from the \"firebase/firestore\" library. We need to import doc to create a reference to a specific document by it's ID. To create that reference, we need to provide the doc function our db instance, the collection the document exists in, and the id of the document. It is possible for this ID to come dynamically from maybe react-router-dom , using the useParams or useLocation method, or maybe by passing along props to an Edit.js component, or by many other ways. In these examples, we are going to \"hardcode\" an ID that we know exists in our FireStore DB. If you are following along, make sure to go to your FireStore DB and get an existing ID from one of your books in the book collection to use in the React example below. First, we will begin with a high overview, followed by a somewhat complex React example that includes a getDocs function called inside a useEffect to get us the data we want to edit. We also talk about Timestamp a little more in depth in this section as well as the \"date\" type input. There is a lot going on here, so make sure to go over it slowly.

The `doc` function // will take in 3 parameters: the `db` instance, the collection we want to // reference, and the ID of the specific document we want to update. const documentRef = doc ( db , \"books\" , \"UniqueID123\" ); { /* Document ID */ } // We await the results of `updateDoc`. `updateDoc` will take in two // parameters: the document reference and the fields we want to update. await updateDoc ( documentRef , { title : \"Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\" , author : \"J. R. R. Tolkien\" , publish_date : Timestamp . fromDate ( new Date ( \"1954-07-27\" )), characters : [ \"Frodo\" , \"Gandalf\" , \"Smeagol\" ] }) // If you look back at the \"Create\" example, you can see I am updating this // current document with a new title and a new character, while the date // stays the same. // NOTE: FireStore will only update the ffields mentioned in the object and will // not overwrite any existing data that is not mentioned. // Check next slide for an example in React. Note: Although you can update data by specifying fields to update, it is normal convention to include all fields in the document when creating a client-side \"edit\" form. In order to do so, you want to make sure you have the documents current data and lay them out in the input fields provided to the user. By doing this, you are preemptively assuring all data is capable of being edited and returned properly to the DB. Even if the user doesn't specifically edit all of the fields, we will be sure that we will still be getting back the same data along with any new data. Update a Document in React w/Comments This is a bigger example, so try to follow along as best you can. We are going to request some data from our FireStore DB so that we can edit it. To this, we need to have a document and it's id to reference that document. We can do this by copying it from the collection on the FireStore console. For this, we are also going to need to import {getDoc} from \"firebase/firestore\" . getDoc will allow us to get a single document, where getDocs , another method we previously used in the R ead example, will get all the documents in a collection. We are also going to import `{Timestamp} from 'firebase/firestore' as the Timestamp constructor will allow us to format a basic Date string into a FireStore timestamp. We will talk a little more about this timestamp as we go through this example. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 import React , { useEffect , useState } from \"react\" ; // Make sure to include all the imports needed in this component import { doc , updateDoc , getDoc , Timestamp } from \"firebase/firestore\" ; // This is a function in another example we are going to use to format a // date.

Why is this important? Well, when we update a document, we want to provide all current data inside the document. We can fill our inputs to have these values already and the user will simply change what needs to be changed and send the whole document back up to update. If we are working with Timestamps, we have to convert that data to a readable format, and break it down even further to be readable by the date input. The date input will return a string in the format of \"YYYY-MM-DD\". When we get our Timestamp from FireStore, and convert to a string using the \"toDate() function, we get a readable date, but we still need to convert this to an even more readable string and also extract the date specifically. We use a JS method called .toLocaleDateString() to get back the date in string format. Ex. \"2014-06-05\" >> \"6/5/2014\". We will take a quick look at the example we used earlier. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 docResults . data (). publish_date . toDate (). toLocaleDateString () // This returns the string in \"6/5/2014\". Let's break it down. docResults . data (). publish_date // returns {seconds: 1402012800, nanoseconds: 0} (see Timestamp Unix Epoch) docResults . data (). publish_date . toDate () // returns \"Thu Jun 05 2014 19:00:00 GMT-0500 (Central Daylight Time)\" docResults . data (). publish_date . toDate (). toLocaleDateString () // finally we get this result: \"6/5/2014\" You would expect that to be enough, but remember, the date input format is \"2014-06-05\", and yes, even the 0's matter as well as the year placement. Since, \"2014-06-05\" is not the same format as \"6/5/2014\", if we try to provide a value to the date input without formatting it, we get an error saying: 1 The specified value \"6/5/2014\" does not conform to the required format, \"yyyy-mm-dd\" In order for a date input to have a default value, we need to format our string to be the format it expects it to be, which is why we have this helper function. Feel free to use it if you decide Timestamps aren't for you! 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 // dateTypeFormatter const dateTypeFormatter = ( date ) => { let newDate = date . split ( \"/\" ); const year = newDate . pop (); newDate . unshift ( year ); if ( newDate [ 1 ]. length < 2 ) { newDate [ 1 ] = \"0\" + newDate [ 1 ]; } if ( newDate [ 2 ]. length < 2 ) { newDate [ 2 ] = \"0\" + newDate [ 2 ]; } newDate = newDate . join ( \"-\" ); console . log ( newDate ); return newDate ; }; export default dateTypeFormatter // import this function wherever you need to format timestamps, i.e. createCarForm... Now all this can be completely unnecessary and entirely up to you. Of course, at the end of the day, you could always just save the date in a string instead of a Timestamp... but where is the fun in that?

Today let\u2019s take a look at putting everything together and understanding the big picture of our fullstack application. Since the first week of this course we presented you with a problem: Build a fullstack application. You have presented your ideas and as we\u2019ve gone further and further you have started drawing out your ideas, created your database but maybe we don\u2019t understand how it all fits together. Let\u2019s try to fix that and give you the big picture overview you\u2019ve been asking for. Fork and clone the github repo down below. Follow along using the repo to maximize the effect. Each section is detailed and gives you all the tools you need to finish your final capstone. The three big picture ideas are broken down and should help you understand how it all fits together. tie it all together Fullstack Check List Ideation & MVP Database and Server Front-end Overview video Each one of these steps are crucial to finish your applications and now let\u2019s break down each step to help you understand how they all work together. Ideation & MVP When you started in course 101 you\u2019ve been planning and writing down all of your ideas, building on them as you've gone through this course. It\u2019s extremely important that every time we start a new project we plan as detailed as possible, so when we start typing our code we already know what we\u2019re doing. While going through this course we made blogs, ER diagrams, and presented our ideas so that in the end we have a solid foundation. We then took the time to understand our data needs and what kind of data we want to store or be able to access. Finally we started drawing what our front end looks like or what the user will see when they access our projects. Hopefully all of this was stored and organized in our Trello boards and if you used Trello you now will see why its a great tool and one that puts you ahead of the curve with planning. Now that we understand this first step take the time to go over your notes and re-read everything. Refresh yourself and then come back for the next step. Database and Server Alright so we\u2019ve planned and planned we did our first step and we have a solid understanding of what were creating. Its time to run through our backend and create our database and server. Remember the backend is the bones and spine of our capstone. To succeed in your final project we need to understand how it all works and then implement this in our own repo. Back-End checklist Create GoogleCloud Database Connect and seed using MySQL workbench Create Github Repo for the source code of your server CI/CD with App Engine, Codeship, Github Okay so we\u2019ve gone through our checklist, watched the video, and really understand how our backend is working. Again take the time to reflect and read everything we just did before moving on to the final step. Front-end We have a solid foundation of what our app does and created our backend to reflect the data we need to use and store. Now it\u2019s time to Create our Client side so we have something unique to show our users. The backend of applications can be overwhelming sometimes, so give yourself a pat on the back finishing it and completing 2/3rds of your capstone! Now it\u2019s time to take all that creativity you have and make something beautiful with it. We learned html, css, and react and now it\u2019s time to use those new react skills. Congratulations!

Overview Last week you started planning and laying out the look and functionality of your app. Hopefully you didn't skip any of those steps and you exchanged contact info with your teammate(s) because we have some more planning practices to teach you. Continuing on... Step 3: Check Your Backend Does it match up with the True Core Functionality of Your App? NOTE: Don\u2019t skip this step. Building your front-end depends on your backend. At the end of your 300 level class, you built a database and server for the start of your Capstone Project. Hopefully, you followed along with the directions to have a solid beginning to your app. However, your ideas have probably changed and maybe your data needs have too. You must draw out the data you\u2019ll need for each component of your app so that you can plan your backend. When signing in, you\u2019ll need access to your users and a POST route to take a username and password for verification. When editing a profile you\u2019ll need a PUT route that takes in user info and updates the user\u2019s data. This is what you\u2019re really learning in this course, how to program, which is to say, you think about the steps a user will take from opening your app to closing your app and all of the data that\u2019s needed to complete those tasks. More on this in Step 5: User Flow Chart . Remember, back-ends come before front-ends. Why? Because the front-end depends on the data coming from the back-end (your server and any third-party APIs you choose to use). Your front-end only serves as an interface for your users to interact with the data you store in the database. Quite simply put, make sure your backend matches your front-end\u2019s needs, first . Take the time to consider what your back-end has now and what may need to change. Work with your partner to clear this up, list it out on your Trello board, and make a plan of action to solve it! Remember: small steps lead to long journeys! Step 4: Sketch out What it Should Look Like, Visually Let\u2019s get out of backend country for a minute and think about what the app looks like to the user. This will build up into Step 5, so don\u2019t skip this one either! What does your app look like when a user arrives at your app\u2019s URL? Do they click \u201cSign-Up\u201d or start typing their information immediately? Draw it. Seriously, go steal your kids paper and map pencils and get to drawing! After the sign-up do they go straight to their profile or do they get a prompt to first enter data related to your app, i.e. in the Budget App mentioned above you might be prompted to enter a budget amount. Draw it. Each time you answer these questions, draw it! Seriously, nothing comes from nothing. So start drawing something, even if it\u2019s horrendously ugly, draw it. You\u2019ll figure it out and make it look better as you build it up. But now is the time to get these ideas into a more solid form; from ethereal/gaseous ideation to moldable jello on paper and eventually to code that tells a browser to do these specific tasks with the UI you envision. Practice Problem In class we'll work on solving problems while communicating to a group. To get better at this (and you will), you'll have to practice on your own every day. YES, the first few times you work on this you're going to get stuck, frustrated, and want to give up. That's okay. Just take a breathe and take some time away from it. Ten minutes later, come back to it. Then look at the answer. Understand how it was solved and try to repeat it for yourself. In this way you can learn from REALLY smart people. Slowly, but surely, you will pick up the patterns. We want you to succeed! To make sure our students are doing the right practice, every day, for themselves we're going to give you a problem to work on here. But if you're wanting more to work on try these sites: HackerRank Geeks4Geeks LeetCode Pramp In fact, you'll want to get on HackerRank and LeetCode sooner rather than later because they actually track your progress and your profile is searchable by hiring managers and recruiters!

It will be a small business app that integrates everything we've learned up until now. During the creation of this app we will make use of state , props , life cycle methods, conditional rendering, Material UI, React Router, authentication (with cookies) and Redux ( mapStateToProps , mapDispatchToProps , thunk ). We are going to create an App that shows a list of small businesses and their details when you click on the them. Additionally, a user can log in and if they are logged in they can add or delete a listing. You will also use thunk, likely to hit an external API, as we integrate the Google Maps API into this project. You will have both class days this week to complete the project and upload your github URL turn it in. Keep in mind that with this project, the goal is to use our existing knowledge of React to build something that looks very similar to the following example images. Unlike some homework assignments where the exact steps are laid out, this project is intentionally vague in some places. It's to get you to learn how to look up things and implement the right resources. That being said, hints will be given in various sections. Just like last time, do your best and have fun! Examples Listings Biz Details Sign-In Admin View Add New Listing Setup Run create-react-app small-business in the folder of your choice to create a project called small-business that will house your application. We will be working from scratch so you will need to create your own github repository for this project. Do that now. Once your project is created (with create-react-app) you can navigate to that directory and run the commands git init and git remote add origin <YOUR_GIT_REPOSITORY> to connect your local application to your remote repository. 1. Initializing Once your app is set up, navigate to the folder and npm install the following dependencies: Checklist of Dependencies @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons cookie google-map-react (optional) react-redux react-router react-router-dom redux redux-thunk All-in-One 1 npm i @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons cookie google-map-react react-redux react-router react-router-dom redux redux-thunk 2. Description of Parts The app will consist of two parts. Parts that are accessible to the public and parts that require a login. Accessible to the Public This will include the Listing component and the Details component. Note that you can call these whatever you like. These correspond to examples 1 and 2. Require a Login Certain functionality on the website should require the user to log in. A login screen is shown in example 3. You'll also want to use some conditional rendering to change the navbar so that if a user is logged in it no longer shows the \"login\" link and instead shows \"logout\". Other things a user can do when logged in are delete a listing and navigate to the \"/add\" page which should be protected by a private route. 3. Parts Breakdown Listing Screen - Example 1 The listing screen should show a table of the small businesses you selected. Please list 4 or 5. Try to take some data from real businesses in town or from another town of your choice. At minimum, the data that is required are: business name description address operating hours It is not a requirement that this table is paginated. You may do so if you like if you intend to add numerous businesses and you think it will degrade the user experience. Details Screen - Example 2 This screen should rearrange the data that is presented in the listing table. It should present it in a user-friendly way and incorporate an outside API to go along with it. We will incorporate the Google Maps API for this. Reference the Google Maps API documentation for this but you will need a Google Cloud account. You should already have this from the JS311 course. I will provide more details about the Google Maps API below. Login Screen - Example 3 This is a simple login form with two fields, a username and a password. Make sure that you use a type of password on the \"password\" input so that we cannot see which characters we are typing. On submit, the form should set a user cookie and possibly store the user in the Redux state. That's up to you. Once logged in, add a small bar below the navbar (it should exist on every page) that notifies the user they are logged in and shows their username. Logged In Listing - Example 4 Conditionally render a \"delete\" column on the table with an icon so that the user can delete a given row. Add Listing Page - Example 5 Provide a form with which the logged-in user can enter data about a new small business and save it. Once saved, it should be added to the Redux store and should automatically be populated in the Listing table when you navigate back to that page. This \"Add\" page should be protected by a private route which means a user can't navigate to it if they are not logged in. Also, it would be cool if you update the Google Map as you fill out the address field so that the user gets a preview regarding the address. You would do something like that using the componentDidUpdate functionality of a class component. Logout When a user clicks the logout button, remove the cookie and reset the \"user\" state in Redux. 4. More Technical Redux State You will probably want at least three properties in your Redux state: user listings map NOTE: You do not have to name these the same way. Redux Actions You'll want actions that delete a listing, add a listing, login/logout, and fetch coordinates for your map given a certain address. You may have more or less depending on how you structure your app. React Router As far as React Router goes, find an example on the web of using private routes. You can search \"Private Routes React\" in Google or look at your previous homework assignments. Your \"isAuthenticated\" function that complements the private route may use the \"cookie\" npm package to parse the cookie. Remember you can set a cookie by writing document.cookie = \"user=<USERNAME>;max-age=60*1000*5; Google Maps Make sure to reference the Google Maps Documentation . You will need to get an API key. Here's a URL example that will retrieve the coordinates for your map given a certain address: https://maps.google.com/maps/api/geocode/json?key=<API_KEY>&address=1600+Amphitheatre+Parkway,+Mountain+View,+CA . You will want to follow the instructions closely on setting up credentials for your API key. Finally on Google Maps, you can use the sample code they provided or use an NPM package that helps incorporate Maps into React. An example of such an NPM package can be found at google-map-react . Login On the login page, you do not actually have to validate the login. Using any username and password combination is fine for this project. Add Listing If you use componentDidUpdate you'll know when certain properties of state have changed. You'll probably be changing these properties as you type in the Text field. If the address has changed, you can use this to call your getCoordinates action (or whatever you named it) and get the lat/lng for your map. This will allow you to update your map in real time. Rubric 20pts - Without logging in a user can: view a list of small businesses view details of each small business 25pts - After a user logs in they can: delete a business listing add a business listing logout 25pts - Redux properly use action creators properly use reducers properly use Redux app state 30pts - Google Maps API is integrated to show small business location","title":"Checkpoint Two"},{"location":"module-4/checkpointTwo-smallBizApp/#checkpoint-two-small-biz-app","text":"This week we will build our second and final application from scratch.

Instructions Part 1 Instructions In your pre-class lesson, you read about the importance of your back-end providing the data your front-end needs to share with users. Get with your partner now and: Take a look at the core functions of your app. Look at the routes and database your server from 311 currently have. What needs to be added? What needs to be changed? Write it out, plan it into tasks, and add it to your Trello board. Bring out the drawings you did last night. Compare and consider. Do you two have the same vision? Are you able to agree? Make re-drawings and plan together what it will look like. Consider too that you've been using Material UI. Should you use the components offered with it? Take pictures of your drawings and add them to your blank sign-in repo in a folder called: planningImages List anything important and link your Trello board to your README.md file so you have a place to gather all of your needed materials. Part 2 Instructions Now that you've got some plans laid out for your Capstone app let's look at your Checkpoint 2 Project . All of the information and instruction you'll need is on that page.

All of this planning is not for naught! It's intended to teach you actual professional practices which are intended to keep you focused and mentally organized. Any time you're feeling overwhelmed it's because you're thinking of all the things to do after what you need to do next. Overview Sometimes our applications are doing what we want them to do and we can't figure out why. The process of figuring out what's wrong with our code and fixing it is called \"debugging\". There are various ways to debug things depending on if you are working on the frontend or the backend. Additionally, some debugging tools even tie into your IDE/text editor (VS Code) and allow you to step through your code line by line. For our purposes we will keep this debugging session focused on the frontend. The Debugger Statement You may have already picked this up along the way but if you want to stop the execution of your code on a certain line you can simply type debugger anywhere in your code. For example: Debugger Statement Example 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 const App = ( props ) => { const count = props . count debugger // <-- JavaScript keyword return ( < div > < h1 > Here ' s our App < /h1> < /div> ) } The debugger will stop your code after the `count variable is initialized. You might put a debugger there to analyze your props if the count is not what you expect. An important thing to note however is that you cannot place the debugger statement inside of HTML code. It needs to be in the JavaScript logic. So that means you can't do something like this: Broken Debugger Statement Example 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 const App = ( props ) => { const count = props . count return ( < div > debugger // <-- JavaScript keyword < h1 > Here ' s our App < /h1> < /div> ) } However, there are still a lot of options for places to use this especially when you are using class components with multiple methods. For example: Another user of the debugger Keyword 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 class App extends Component { state = { text : '' } submit = ( e ) => { e . preventDefault () // check text const text = this . state . text debugger // make an api call with a redux action: submitForm this . props . submitForm ( text ) } render () { return ( < div > < form onSubmit = { this . submit } > < TextField value = { this . text } /> < Button type = \"submit\" > Submit < /Button> < /form> < /div> ) } } And yes it also means you can use the debugger statement in your Redux actions or reducers. debugger used in Redux Action 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 const users = ( state = [], action ) => { switch ( action . type ) { case 'ADD_USER' : // check value debugger return [ ... state , action . value ] default : return state } } Once the debugger stops, you can then \"step over\", \"step into\" or \"step out of\" different functions and lines of code. These are shown by the buttons on the bottom left. The \"play\" button will resume execution and take you either to the next debugger statement or simply stop debugging if there's nothing left to do. The most common operation is the \"step over\" button indicated by the circular arrow. Clicking that button will take you to the next line of code. Console Log Another way of debugging is to make use of console.log statements. This is another thing you've already seen but we can brush up on where to use it and how to see it in the browser. In your JS311 class, when you console.log ged something it showed up in the terminal. That's not how it works with code on the front-end. When you use the console.log statement in React the items that you logged appear in the browser's console just like in 101. Again, just like the debugger statement, this can be placed anywhere in the JavaScript context of your code. So for example in our reducer: Log Statement in a Redux Reducer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 const users = ( state = [], action ) => { switch ( action . type ) { case 'ADD_USER' : console . log ( 'The user: ' , action . value ) return [ ... state , action . value ] default : return state } } And now the user will be logged to the console window.

We are going to do something very similar for our React apps. This pre-homework will show you how to combine your frontend and your backend into one working app. Overview We learned in the last class why deploying our apps is a necessity. We want everyone on the internet to be able to access what we've created right? Now we also want to combine our frontend and backends and have both projects from JS311 and JS411 working in tandem. Deploying with GCP Basically what we are going to do is make use of the knowledge we gained last time about what the build process does in create-react-app , and combine that with Express's use.static functionality to serve the built files. We've created a simple repo for you to get started with. Let's practice these steps and then you will practice again by combining your app with your project from JS311. Clone the following express repo Copy your entire folder from your current React app into the gcloud-express/ folder and rename the app: client/ Hint: You might want to delete the node_modules/ folder inside of your React app to make the copying quicker Navigate to the new client/ folder inside of gcloud-express/ If you removed the node_modules/ folder you will want to re-install the dependencies by running npm i in the client/ folder. After that's done, run npm run build to generate the static files. Now run npm start inside of gcloud-express/ and you should see your app running in the browser The setup is complete and now it's time to deploy your application: First, let's create a new project under the GCloud account that we set up in JS311. To do that, click on the project button as shown. It will display a modal that looks like this: Click \"New Project\" in the upper right-hand corner and name the project ACA-express . If you have any trouble with that name try adding a random number after it. Once the project has been created there's only one thing left to do. Go to the terminal where the gcloud-express repo is and run the command gcloud app deploy . --project=aca-express . Important: If you added a random number after your project name you will want to add it to this command as well If this is the first time you are running the command you will be asked to specify a region. Choose \"us-east-1\" which should be number 13. Then continue the upload process. Navigate to the dashboard page of \"App Engine\" (you can search for App Engine on the main Google Cloud page) and find your app's url. For example, aca-express.appspot.com . Open the app and you should see your project running. for creating a new project and then specify that project id in the gcloud app deploy command. Working with APIs During your time at ACA you've learned how to use fetch and also axios to make API requests. At some point, you probably already tried to hit your JS311 APIs from your JS411 React app, but if you didn't we'll talk about it. Prior to combining the two apps, if you wanted to hit your API from JS311 you needed the full gcloud url of that app engine project. It may have looked something like this: my-project.appspot.com . So if you wanted to hit an API you created to get users for example you would do a fetch like this: Example API Request 1 2 3 4 5 fetch ( 'https://my-project.appspot.com/users' ) . then ( res => res . json ()) . then ( data => { // do something with users data }) Note: You may not have a users endpoint, that was just an example The only change here is that when the two Apps are combined, so you no longer need the whole URL and can simply run: Example API Request in same folder 1 2 3 4 5 fetch ( '/users' ) . then ( res => res . json ()) . then ( data => { // do something with users data }) Since the frontend and backend are being served from the same place, Express knows how to handle this. The only situation that could arise is if you named a route the same thing in Express and React Router. For example if you had a page called /users on the frontend. Try to avoid that situation by calling it /listusers or something like that. After this you should be good to go! If you have any issues deploying your app talk to the instructor. The hardest part is making sure your app runs locally. If it runs locally, deployment is fairly simple. Practice It We are going to follow the previous steps to include our React projects into our apps from JS311. There will be a couple small changes. Follow the previous steps to copy your JS411 React app into your JS311 Express app You will need to make two changes to your JS311 project. Include app.use(express.static('./client/build')) in the express/index.js file Add \"homepage\": \".\" to your JS311 package.json file Now run npm start in your JS311 project and it should serve up your React app just like last time. If so it's time to deploy. If you want to override/update your JS311 project with these changes you can simply run gcloud app deploy . which will upload to your default project. If you want it in a different project, follow the previous steps Additional Resources We normally provided you with a link to the official documentation of any subject we teach in the pre-homework, but today we'll leave with you with a number of resources that may help you build your Capstone Project or other apps in your future. Migrate to AWS, a Cheaper Deployment Strategy for Students - GCP is usually cheaper to get started with but you may soon lose credits. As an alternative one of our instructors, Matt Huntsberry, as put together a tutorial to help you host with AWS when your GCP credits run out. Typography - Seriously, if you have no eye for design but care that your app is beautiful you may want to use this site for some ideas and code. Atomic Design - When designing your app I hope you came across this website but if not here it is. A full idea of designing an application, atomically! Front-End Design Checklist - Maybe you came across this too in your google-ing. Nonetheless, it is a rad resource for any developer of any experience. API First Development - Think your backend is less important? Think again. Building with Angular Material Tutorial - a clean crisp guide to Angular intricacies. Front-End Designs - If you care about design and want to know more... Google.io - Shadow DOM, HTML Templates - Want to know more about the DOM and Shadow DOM? Ask google. Planning a Front-End JavaScript Application - JavaScript is awesome and older developers are stupid. Make sure you get the real scoop on what JS can do and how you should approach it. Human JavaScript - For your time after graduation when you're looking to get stronger in your skills. Get to reading this book! Dispelling Bullshit - Angular, React, Backbone, Ember, Vue, it doesn't matter.

We've created a simple repo for you to get started with. Let's practice these steps and then you will practice again by combining your app with your project from JS311. Clone the following express repo Copy your entire folder from your current React app into the gcloud-express/ folder and rename the app: client/ Hint: You might want to delete the node_modules/ folder inside of your React app to make the copying quicker Navigate to the new client/ folder inside of gcloud-express/ If you removed the node_modules/ folder you will want to re-install the dependencies by running npm i in the client/ folder. After that's done, run npm run build to generate the static files. Now run npm start inside of gcloud-express/ and you should see your app running in the browser The setup is complete and now it's time to deploy your application: First, let's create a new project under the GCloud account that we set up in JS311. To do that, click on the project button as shown. It will display a modal that looks like this: Click \"New Project\" in the upper right-hand corner and name the project ACA-express . If you have any trouble with that name try adding a random number after it. Once the project has been created there's only one thing left to do. Go to the terminal where the gcloud-express repo is and run the command gcloud app deploy . --project=aca-express . Important: If you added a random number after your project name you will want to add it to this command as well If this is the first time you are running the command you will be asked to specify a region. Choose \"us-east-1\" which should be number 13. Then continue the upload process. Navigate to the dashboard page of \"App Engine\" (you can search for App Engine on the main Google Cloud page) and find your app's url. For example, aca-express.appspot.com . Open the app and you should see your project running. for creating a new project and then specify that project id in the gcloud app deploy command.","title":"Deploying with GCP"},{"location":"module-4/deployment/#working-with-apis","text":"During your time at ACA you've learned how to use fetch and also axios to make API requests. At some point, you probably already tried to hit your JS311 APIs from your JS411 React app, but if you didn't we'll talk about it. Prior to combining the two apps, if you wanted to hit your API from JS311 you needed the full gcloud url of that app engine project. It may have looked something like this: my-project.appspot.com . So if you wanted to hit an API you created to get users for example you would do a fetch like this: Example API Request 1 2 3 4 5 fetch ( 'https://my-project.appspot.com/users' ) . then ( res => res . json ()) . then ( data => { // do something with users data }) Note: You may not have a users endpoint, that was just an example The only change here is that when the two Apps are combined, so you no longer need the whole URL and can simply run: Example API Request in same folder 1 2 3 4 5 fetch ( '/users' ) . then ( res => res . json ()) . then ( data => { // do something with users data }) Since the frontend and backend are being served from the same place, Express knows how to handle this. The only situation that could arise is if you named a route the same thing in Express and React Router. For example if you had a page called /users on the frontend. Try to avoid that situation by calling it /listusers or something like that. After this you should be good to go! If you have any issues deploying your app talk to the instructor. The hardest part is making sure your app runs locally.

Review & Recap Heads up! This week is another App development week where you will have the entirety of the time to build a working application based on the specifications provided on the class page. That being said, we think it's useful to keep providing you with content in these pre-work sections. It will help you gain more understanding and hopefully inform you on topics that might come up in your interview questions when you are applying for developer jobs, so don't skip this. Overview We're going over this because we think it's important that you understand the \"why\" behind what we are doing. You've seen .gitignore and other various files but you might not fully understand why we would want to \"ignore\" these files for example. We'll dive into that, and other various topics in a second. Folder Structure When you first run create-react-app (CRA) you end up with a directory that looks like this: Basic CRA Folder Structure 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 // my-app -- node_modules -- public -- src -- .gitignore -- package-lock.json -- package.json -- README.md Let's talk about each of these in some quick detail. node_modules/ This folder holds all of your project's dependencies. It is not there by default when you clone something from Git. It gets generated when you run the npm install command. If you ran npm install express then you should expect to see a folder titled express underneath node_modules . Since React is installed by default with create-react-app , we see something like this: Node Modules Structure 1 2 3 4 5 6 ... -- react -- react-app-polyfill -- react-dev-utils -- react-dom ... What are react-app-polyfill and react-dev-utils ? I didn't install those? You're right, that means something else probably did. If you expand one of those folders underneath node_modules you'll see that they each have their own package.json file just like our project does. ...Our dependencies also have dependencies...inception. Inception 1 Inception 2 Inception 3 No GIF public/ The public/ folder is the main starting point of our app. It holds a few key files for getting started and it's directory structure looks like this: public/ Folder Structure 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ```console -- favicon.ico -> image in the corner of browser tab -- index.html -> main starting file -- logo192.png -> logo image -- logo512.png -> different sized logo image -- manifest.json -> site settings -- robots.txt -> seo settings ``` I've briefly pointed out what most of these files do but I want to talk a little more about the main file which is index.html. Everything you put here will be loaded into your app once a \"build\" is created. If you wanted to use Bootstrap for example you might load in some extra css/js with a <link> or <script> tag. You would put those in this index.html file. Also of importance . . . look near the bottom of this file in the \"body\" tags. Notice this: <div id=\"root\"></div> . Now go to index.js under the scr folder and notice this: ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root')); . See a correlation? That tag in the index.html file is where your whole React app gets inserted/rendered. src This is the main folder for writing your React code. Its directory structure looks like this: src/ Folder Structure 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 -- App.css -- App.js -- App.test.js -- index.css -- index.js -- logo.svg -- serviceWorker.js Here we have the JS and CSS for the App component, the JS and CSS for the index.js file, a test.js file, a logo.svg and a service worker. Typically, when we start with a React app, we start writing our code in the App component. We also typically create a folder called components/ to hold our custom components and a folder called containers/ if we hook Redux to our app. Do not worry about the serviceWorker.js file. That's an advanced subject that we won't cover in this course and it's not required to build React applications. .gitignore This is a file that tells us which files/folders we want Git to ignore. Sounds self-explanatory doesn't it? This means that if we add a file or folder that exists in the .gitignore file, Git won't even show it as an untracked file. That means it will never get uploaded to our repository. What kinds of things would we want to be ignored from our repository? node_modules , .env ...? Why Ignore node_modules/ Our node_modules / folder is typically very large. Because of that, it takes longer to upload/download from our repository. But there's another reason we don't want these files to be tracked in Git and that's because Git is used for version control. It's used to save a running history of the files we've touched and the changes we've made. We are never going to manually change our node_modules . Let's take it one step further. We already have a blueprint of our node_modules/ folder locally. That's what our package.json file is for. It knows about all the dependencies we need. And we already mentioned that the node_modules/ folder gets created when we run npm install . So there is absolutely no reason to upload our node_modules/ folder to Github. That rule follows in other languages as well and is considered general best practice. You don't upload your dependencies (any third-party code) to Github. Why Ignore .env Simple put, the .env file is ALWAYS filled with sensitive information like our API Keys and Database login credentials. For this reason we NEVER want to include it with our code pushes to a repo...even if it's a private repo. Instead you can use GitHub sensitive data tool or add the needed environment variables to the hosting platform manually when you setup your pipeline initially. Talk to your instructor to make sure you understand this. package.json As we mentioned above, the package.json file keeps a list of all the dependencies you have for your application. But it can do more that that. It's also the place where the \"scripts\" for your application are stored. These scripts are the commands like npm start . For example, by default create-react-app provides the following scripts: package.json file 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ```json \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"react-scripts start\", \"build\": \"react-scripts build\", \"test\": \"react-scripts test\", \"eject\": \"react-scripts eject\" } ``` The start script runs your application, as you know. The build script builds a production version of your application to be served statically (by an express app perhaps). When that script is run a build/ folder is created on the top level of your application above the public/ folder. We can talk more about what is actually going on in that process in the next pre-homework and in class. Needless to say, the package.json file is basically the blueprint of your application. The app won't work without it. package-lock.json This file is an extension of the package.json file. It controls the versions for all the dependencies of your dependencies as we saw earlier with the node_modules/ folder by locking them in-place. Before NPM 5, there was only a package.json file. That was fine for a long time but eventually developers realized their code was getting out of sync because the sub-dependencies would change versions. Let's give an example. You run this command npm i express and it populates your package.json with the following: Example package.json File 1 2 3 ```json \"dependencies\": { \"express\": \"^4.17.1\" } ``` Great. Now everyone that uses your application and runs npm install will get express version 4.17.1 and all is good. We realized we had a little problem though and that's because express also has dependencies and so a portion of their dependency tree looks like this: Example package.json File - Varying Dependencies 1 2 3 \"dependencies\" : { \"body-parser\" : \"1.19.0\" , } So what ended up happening is someone would bump the version for body-parser to 1.20.0 and express would inherit that change without changing its own version and then the code would break because while everyone you shared your app with is still getting express version 4.17.1 , express behind the scenes is now using body-parser version 1.20.0 and it's possible that change caused some unexpected side-effect. Ok . . . that's a lot of information but now that we understand that we can understand what package-lock.json does. It essentially locks down the whole dependency tree so that every dependency you install, and all of its dependencies will always have the same versions and you won't run into the issues I described above. It's important to commit your package-lock.json file to GitHub for this reason. README.md The last file we want to talk about is the README.md file . This one is probably the most self-explanatory. Its purpose is to provide instructions/guidelines for setting up and running your application. It should give your users a clue as to what your application does and how to start it. Optionally, you can provide instructions on how to contribute to your project. Summary Hopefully you found this helpful and have a better understanding of what happens when you run create-react-app. In the next pre-homework we'll get into what happens when you build your application.

Review and Recap Hopefully all of this planning is bringing to you clarity of your app and the work ahead. I'm sure you've never thought like this and it's opening new pathways in your mind. This is a good thing! Learning to program and learning to program well are two different skills that will help you do other things in your life better. If you didn't believe it before, believe it now: there's still more planning to your app before you actually get to build. Crazy, right!? This is what actually goes into the apps you know and love. For every app you use there is a paper mockup of it. There is a flow chart, code plan, and kanban board used to build it. Today we're going to continue with npm and planning the User Flow of our app. In class we'll be planning our Capstone Project and working on our ATX-Small Business App! Overview Why are we talking about the npm build command? This is something you should already know about and have hopefully been using throughout this course. The purpose of this pre-work isn't to re-introduce you to the command, it's to explain what's going on behind the scenes when you run it. Why npm build To understand what's happening we first need to remind (or inform) you that the browser can't naturally read React code. What do I mean when I say the browser? Chrome. Firefox. Edge. And why does it matter what the browser can read? Well because that's where our applications are running. They are websites, after all! You may have already known all that but it's important to reiterate. Now, because the browser can't naturally read code that looks like this: Simple React Component 1 2 3 4 5 export MyComponent = ( props ) => { < div > < h1 > Welcome to my component < /h1> < /div> } ...because it's neither plain JavaScript nor HTML (it's a mixture of both), we need to do something with this code to format it in a way that the browser can read. There are two main things we need to do. Transpilation We need to transpile our code into something the browser knows how to read. We need to transpile it into plain JavaScript. Additionally, you may be writing code in new ES ways that aren't supported in the browser yet. For example, for a while ES6 functionality like arrow functions and imports wasn't supported in the browser (it is now) so we needed to transpile that code in ES2015 format. Minification We need to make the files as small as possible. That means removing all extra space in our files and sometimes changing variable names from something longer like myFunction to mf (hehe). Why are we doing this? Because it decreases the time it takes for the browser to load the file. The smaller the file, the better the performance on the web. Don't worry, create-react-app handles all this logic behind the scenes and you don't need to do anything extra. Just know that transpilation and minification are some of the main things that are happening when you run the npm build command. Let's look at some examples. The Build Folder When you run the npm build command a folder is generated called build . Let's look at what's inside: Build Folder Structure 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 -- static -- asset-manifest.json -- favicon.ico -- index.html -- logo192.png -- logo512.png -- manifest.json -- precache-manifest... -- robots.txt -- service-worker.js You'll notice that a lot of this is basically copied over from the \"public\" folder we talked about last class. We want to focus on the two main parts of this build folder: index.html and the static (folder). index.html This is the main starting point of your application. To see what's changed since the public/ folder, let's open up the index.html file from the build/ folder. You may notice that it's all on one line. That's because it's been minified . Well it's super ugly and we actually want to look at certain parts of it so go ahead and navigate to the following website: https://unminify.com/ . Once there, copy the contents of build/index.html and paste them in the box. It should have formatted the content for you. Near the top of this file you should see the following: <link href=\"/asset-v1:ACA+JS411+09282020_JS411_C6+type@asset+block/css_main.34de6062.chunk.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> That's all the bundled css that exists in your application, all in one file. Near the bottom of the file you should see the following: <script src=\"/asset-v1:ACA+JS411+09282020_JS411_C6+type@asset+block/js_2.c633e371.chunk.js\"></script> That's all the bundled javascript code (all of your React code) in one file. NOTE: The random numbers get generated different when the build is run so don't worry if your filename isn't exactly the same. static If you notice above, both the css link and the javascript script reference /static/ . That represents the static folder in your \"build\" folder. That's where all the transpiled and minified code lives. It's all the code you've written in React, just in a different format. Let's go take a look at these files. Go to the static/js folder and click on the top file. Don't worry about the other ones in this folder. The file we are looking for should end in chunk.js . The file should look similar to this: Minified Code 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 ( window [ \"webpackJsonpmy-ssr-app\" ] = window [ \"webpackJsonpmy-ssr-app\" ] || []). push ([[ 2 ],[ function ( e , t , n ){ \"use strict\" ; e . exports = n ( 4 )}, function ( e , t , n ){ \"use strict\" ; var r = Object . getOwnPropertySymbols , l = Object . prototype . hasOwnProperty , i = Object . prototype . propertyIsEnumerable ; function a ( e ){ if ( null === e || void 0 === e ) throw new TypeError ( \"Object.assign cannot be called with null or undefined\" ); return Object ( e )} e . exports = function (){ try { if ( !

Zen Summary This seems like a lot of information but you really don't need to know all of it in detail. What you need to understand is that the npm build command gets your code ready for a production environment by bundling it ( transpiling and minifying ) into a build/ folder that contains static files. What this also means is that you don't have to run npm start anymore (after you've built). We'll explore that in the practice section and show you how your app would run in production. Practice It We are going to create a new project with create-react-app, build the app and then load the static files from our browser. Run create-react-app build-ex to create a project called build-ex Navigate to that folder and run npm i to get all your dependencies Now run npm start to see the default create-react-app which you should have seen a couple times by now Run the npm build command. It should have generated the build/ folder that we've been talking about today. Since we've already explored the contents of that file, we don't need to do that again here Now, in VSCode (or another editor) right-click on the build folder and select \"copy path\" Open a new web browser tab and paste the file path into the browser. You should see a directory show up. Click on the index.html file. That's the main starting point of your application Don't see anything? Add \"homepage\": \".\" as a property to the bottom of your package.json object and re-run npm build . This will sync all the files to the current folder. Now reload the page and you should see your app loaded Note: If you could not copy the exact path you can type file:/// in the browser and navigate to that build folder manually.

Learning to program and learning to program well are two different skills that will help you do other things in your life better. If you didn't believe it before, believe it now: there's still more planning to your app before you actually get to build. Crazy, right!? This is what actually goes into the apps you know and love.

What do I mean when I say the browser? Chrome. Firefox. Edge. And why does it matter what the browser can read? Well because that's where our applications are running. They are websites, after all! You may have already known all that but it's important to reiterate. Now, because the browser can't naturally read code that looks like this: Simple React Component 1 2 3 4 5 export MyComponent = ( props ) => { < div > < h1 > Welcome to my component < /h1> < /div> } ...because it's neither plain JavaScript nor HTML (it's a mixture of both), we need to do something with this code to format it in a way that the browser can read. There are two main things we need to do. Transpilation We need to transpile our code into something the browser knows how to read. We need to transpile it into plain JavaScript. Additionally, you may be writing code in new ES ways that aren't supported in the browser yet. For example, for a while ES6 functionality like arrow functions and imports wasn't supported in the browser (it is now) so we needed to transpile that code in ES2015 format. Minification We need to make the files as small as possible. That means removing all extra space in our files and sometimes changing variable names from something longer like myFunction to mf (hehe). Why are we doing this? Because it decreases the time it takes for the browser to load the file. The smaller the file, the better the performance on the web. Don't worry, create-react-app handles all this logic behind the scenes and you don't need to do anything extra.

Click the New button in the top-right corner of the window. Enter ACA_web101_yourFirstName_yourLastName in the Repository name field. NOTE: Change firstName for your actual first name and lastName for your actual last name. Enter This is my ACA portfolio in the Description field. Leave the Public radio button selected. Check the Add a README file checkbox. (this will create a README.md file for you to take notes in.) Click the Create repository button. Once the repo is created, click the Code button and copy the link it provides in the drop-down menu by clicking on the icon that looks like a page with the arrow pointing left. Go back to your terminal. Type git clone and paste the link you copied from your repo on GitHub to clone the repo onto your computer: git clone paste-that-link-here-and-replace-me Press the Enter key and watch it work! You will need to create a repo for most assignments and every time you want to start a new project on your own, for a friend or whenever you want to build something new. Keep this instructions handy as they will be the same in the future. Move Your Project Files For the first assignment, you've already been working in a folder that is NOT a Git repo. And, you have a new repo with nothing but a README file in it. To continue, you need to move the files of myPortfolio folder into your ACA_web101_yourname folder so Git can move your project to GitHub. Navigate to your finder/file explorer on your computer and open two separate windows. Navigate to your ACA_web101_yourname folder in the first window. Navigate to your myPortfolio folder in the other window. Drag the files of myPortfolio folder into the ACA_web101_yourname folder in the first window. There is a way to turn a folder on your computer into a git repo using git init but that's an abstract lesson for where we are in your learning journey now. In the future, we will walk you through that method but for now, just copy/paste or drag and drop the files into the newly cloned folder/repo. Push to GitHub You've created a new repo, cloned it to your local machine, and moved your myPortfolio folder with your project files into the new repo. Now it's time to push your files to GitHub. Open your terminal, and cd (change directory) to your ACA_web101_yourname folder: Example: cd ACA_web101_yourname TIP: Type the first few letters of the folder and press Tab , and the terminal will fill in the rest of the folder name. You will see the full directory path with ( main ) or ( master ) at the end. This confirms you are in a Git repo and on the main / master branch. Type git status + Enter . You will see your myPortfolio folder (or a list of files) that have been changed in red. Type git add -A + Enter to add/ track all files to what will be committed . You won't get a message back. Type git status + Enter again and you will see the files you just staged to commit now in green. Type git commit -m \"moved files into repo\" + Enter to commit your changes (the files you just moved over) so they're ready( staged ) to be sent to GitHub. You will see a summary of changes about to be pushed in white. the commit command takes an argument -m for \"message\" followed by some plain text inside \" \" . This is for you to write a detailed message about the code changes you've made so your team can easily reference & understand the updates. Type git push + Enter to push your files to GitHub. You will see the a success messages in white. IF you get a DENIED error you may need to redo your Git Configurations with the proper email/username and password IF you get a fatal message: 1 2 fatal: The current branch example-branch has no upstream branch. To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use simply copy/paste the command it gives you: git push --set-upstream origin <example-branch> See Git & Terminal Commands for a full list of commands.

And, you have a new repo with nothing but a README file in it. To continue, you need to move the files of myPortfolio folder into your ACA_web101_yourname folder so Git can move your project to GitHub. Navigate to your finder/file explorer on your computer and open two separate windows. Navigate to your ACA_web101_yourname folder in the first window. Navigate to your myPortfolio folder in the other window. Drag the files of myPortfolio folder into the ACA_web101_yourname folder in the first window. There is a way to turn a folder on your computer into a git repo using git init but that's an abstract lesson for where we are in your learning journey now. In the future, we will walk you through that method but for now, just copy/paste or drag and drop the files into the newly cloned folder/repo.","title":"Move Your Project Files"},{"location":"preCourse/submittingHomework/#push-to-github","text":"You've created a new repo, cloned it to your local machine, and moved your myPortfolio folder with your project files into the new repo.

You will see the full directory path with ( main ) or ( master ) at the end. This confirms you are in a Git repo and on the main / master branch. Type git status + Enter . You will see your myPortfolio folder (or a list of files) that have been changed in red. Type git add -A + Enter to add/ track all files to what will be committed . You won't get a message back. Type git status + Enter again and you will see the files you just staged to commit now in green. Type git commit -m \"moved files into repo\" + Enter to commit your changes (the files you just moved over) so they're ready( staged ) to be sent to GitHub. You will see a summary of changes about to be pushed in white. the commit command takes an argument -m for \"message\" followed by some plain text inside \" \" . This is for you to write a detailed message about the code changes you've made so your team can easily reference & understand the updates. Type git push + Enter to push your files to GitHub. You will see the a success messages in white.

Why? Our instructors don\u2019t lecture in class. Instead, our instructors guide you through multiple challenges including logic problems, presentations, interview questions, and application programming challenges. To use the class time effectively you and all of your classmates must complete the assigned pre-homework. If you and your classmates do this you\u2019ll be able to get into class and really ask good questions, apply what you\u2019re learning at home and advance your skills more quickly. This program is built to accommodate full-time employment through part-time classes BUT you will not learn everything you need to learn in these 5 hours/week. YOU MUST READ, WATCH, PRACTICE, and RESEARCH on your own. Each of the sections in your pre-lesson homeworks have been honed in through years of training student-developers to focus on what they really need to learn in a very short amount of time. Trust the process, do the work, sacrifice time now for your future, and GSD ! Flipped Classroom: What The short? You read and study outside of class and apply that knowledge in class with the support of your classmates and instructor. No pride. No ego. No shame. A more academic definition can be found here . But the following videos do well to explain it well. Either way, this approach works and works well. The only challenge now is to shape your mindset around it. The Flipped Classroom: Why In the traditional classroom , the teacher is the central focus of a lesson. The teacher responds to questions while students defer directly to the teacher for guidance and feedback. In a classroom with a traditional style of instruction, individual lessons may be focused on an explanation of content utilizing a lecture-style. Typically, this pattern of teaching also involves giving students the task of reading from a textbook or practicing a concept by working on a problem set, for example, outside school. In a flipped classroom students are required to study the content of the lecture outside of class by reading, watching videos and fiddling with code. Class time with the instructor is then mostly reserved for questions over the content, small discussions of related topics and then dedicated guided practice time on each project. This way students get access to a professional programmer when they need it, during problems and struggles. This approach may feel difficult at first but this methodology has been proven to work and is well suited for both adult learners and part-time education. The Flipped Classroom: How WATCH, READ, PRACTICE, RESEARCH, AND WRITE Every Pre-Homework will have a video to WATCH. These videos are incredibly important to help build context for why you\u2019ll be learning the upcoming concept. Watch all videos that are given to you even if they\u2019re 30 mins, 60 mins or just 5 mins. Watch them all! They were built or chosen because they teach what we need you to learn. READ ALL of the pre-homework given to you. Each lesson has been carefully thought out and crafted to guide you through, sometimes, very complex or technically intricate processes. Make sure you understand the concepts by reading every article that\u2019s suggested. PRACTICE Most pre-homework will have Practice It sections where you can apply the lesson you\u2019ve just watched and read about. This section is where you actually learn! Don\u2019t cut yourself short. DO THE PRACTICE PROBLEM ! Put it in a Repl.it and don\u2019t stop fidgeting with it until you completely understand it. RESEARCH your questions! ALL questions can be answered on the internet. Don\u2019t wait until you get to class to answer low hanging fruit. Find it on the internet. Then you can use your class time to ask harder questions with deeper understanding. At the end of most pre-lesson homeworks you\u2019ll see a list of Terms to Know & Questions for Discussion . If you can\u2019t describe or answer them to another person you need to go look them up on Google, read or watch a video on them, then WRITE down your understanding of each one in your journal. WRITE your blogging questions every week. You\u2019ll see a lesson on creating your blog account on Medium.com in the Pre-Course Lessons, so you can publish your thoughts on multiple subjects.
